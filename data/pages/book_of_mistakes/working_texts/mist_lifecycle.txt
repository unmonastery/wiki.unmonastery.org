====== Lifecycle ======

|Throughout the planning phase of the first unMonastery, a 3-year commitment to the host city was envisioned. Since the goal was to work towards positive change together with the local community, the necessary links were to be developed, language skills acquired, models developed and tested, before unMonasterians would be ready to remove themselves and leave behind tangible, working implementations. When the first opportunity emerged to launch the prototype, the financial framework was offered for 4 months. Although it was stretched into 6 months, the time period proved to be too short to achieve even a fully finished trial of the model.|

**1.0 Evolution finds its own rhythm.  It may be possible to implant vision, but the exercise of it is greatly refined by a step by step experience of the forces that feed this vision.  The parachuting of top-down understandings devised for other climes and other constellations provoked the following prayer for organic resistance…**

"//In the conceptual stages, it is not always strategic to accept compromises before one is forced to do so.  Keep the dreams big enough to do some real work.  My experience is that one year can be a frustrating short period of time:  we'd get there, sweep out the bureaucratic encumbrances, solve the logistics of food and water, meet some fascinating people, launch a few roughly sketched ideas, and start to pack.//" (( In a letter to Ben Vickers July 2012 the unWisdom of the quick fix was aired.  It continued...

"//In the art of community development, one is advised to proceed gingerly.  To assure that the mission's work corresponds with genuine/perceived needs - one establishes ones existence through ones own projects, and then waits (patiently) for the community to figure out how they can use you.  After that the true collaboration / cross fertilisation can occur.  In the end, one can retreat almost unnoticed as the local population now runs a viable concern.  I'd suggest that a three year time frame would more easily house these three stages. Also it may (or may not) be easier to generate local enthusiasm for something that is going to be active for a while...?

That said short visits can work, I have witnessed a very effective skills transfusion program in the Balkans where a team of facilitators working out of Wien descended upon a town with a circus tent over twelve containers. These, in addition to providing self-sufficiency in cooking and housing, opened to become recording studios, printing shops etc where the residents offered various courses.  They did some very good work in only six weeks, though by their third year on the road they had halved the number of towns per year, and doubled their stay to 3 months.  Their most concrete contribution was to leave behind a functioning local radio station at each community.//"))


**The unMonastery ... is //‘something doing something’//; its fruits won’t mature until after its doors are closed.  Dwelling upon, wrestling with and periods of contemplation provide another kind of truth.** ((As the first unMonasterians left Matera at the tail end of the prototype sessions a minor sensation exploded; it was revealed that the 'good people' had turned upon our sponsor the operative wing of the MA2019 Comitato.  The program dossier designed to flesh out the bid to become the official European Capital of Culture with concrete projects was to be mirrored by a self-appointed knife-wielding shadow committee of critical citizens.  **They would be writing what amounted to an unBid**... [[http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/25/creative-deconstruction/]]
Reports of a well-tasting rapprochement have reached our ears. ))

“Although the premise of the unMonastery has long been based upon a three-year cycle, the clever ploy of a 4-month condensed prototype has brought a valued extra pressure. As was always the case in the generic three-year unMonastery model, the ‘in-house’ activity would constitute a large proportion of our Landing Year.  The 4-month compacted version of the Matera Prototype has always invited to the inevitable frustration of compromise.  Our perhaps protracted initial adaptive phase may appear from the outside as excessively introverted, but is in fact an essential gestation period during which we explore fault lines and distill leadership.” ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))



**The unMonastery could not respond to a forced timeline.** 

"//Salverio liked the imagery of ‘my hose speech’, it was a fitting metaphor.  Beyond adjusting our nozzle to form a veritable fountain of ideas, it spoke of wisdom.  Community cannot grow a presto.  Roots resist transplantation; no matter how impressive the PR department exhorting the glories of the Rubinetto, a trickle is but a trickle. ("Concealed beneath the rim of the table was the unmentionable fact that until the hose was attached to the water supply of the citizenry, it was virtually useless…") ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))    
   
The originally floated unMo working model of one year preparing the ground, one year cultivating collaborations, one year handing over the tools - can perhaps be compressed with appreciable benefit, but it is unlikely that top down exhortations to speed up has suddenly become a viable strategy for community development.  Even with water, earth, seeds and generous fertiliser all in place, we cannot speed up the seasons.  **The cycles of landing and launching, labouring and perhaps loving all take their time.**  The unMo idea still requires an organic pace.  Forcing it provokes false steps.   
   
The previous generation of lightbulbs worked through resistance: the greater the resistance, the greater the heat and light generated.  Actors are similar, the slower it takes for information to work its way into the consciousness, the deeper it sits.  Quick fixes and decisions fly by or bounce off.  Dwelling upon, wrestling with and periods of contemplation provide another kind of truth.

In the quick fix modus, the unMo took a promising, flashy initiative...  we sought to define ourselves...//" ((--- an orphaned BD snippet.)) ((An early draft of ideas adhering to the productive april 2014 period of the Scribe.))


=== Landing, Lurching, Launching  ===

"The Matera Prototipo behaved as unMonasteries everywhere.  The initial landing phase that involved locating any available source of hot water and becoming intimate with the fuse box gently eased into a period of apparent paralysis.

Buoyed only by their residual unFaith and the collective commitment to make the most of our culinary skills, the unMonks seemingly cowled in their cowls.  The accompanying phase of Culture Shock became reinforced as we absorbed the realities of our concentric //Vows of Deprivation//.  To emerge again as a cohesive, coherent band of devotees would indeed be a tall order.

 
**Feelings of sacredness are not immediately contagious; they require active transference.**"(( Blog april  ?))
