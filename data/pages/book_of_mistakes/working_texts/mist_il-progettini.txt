====== Projects ====== 

    
"//A possible approach could be to merge the selection process with a process built to ensure that the projects developed within the Unmonastery resonate with the local community. For example, you could get a pool of local projects, needs and people as a knowledge base; candidate Unmonks of all genders would angle their projects so as to maximize local impact and interaction, and then post them somewhere online; we could then involve the local people in the selection of Unmonks and their projects, based on the collaboration they see happening. The whole thing looks like matchmaking: great for ensuring collaboration, but I would hate to see great ideas go to waste because they don’t match with anything on the ground – the whole point of having the Unmonastery in a place like Matera is to inject some novelty.//"  ((https://edgeryders.eu/en/mine-becomes-ours/mission_case/choosing-projects-and-people-another-unmonastery-design-problem)) 

|At the unMonastery first prototype, each unMonasterian had their own project. Their selection was partially based on a proposal to address one of the [[https://edgeryders.eu/en/unmonastery/summary-challenges-matera|12 challenges]], and everyone arrived ready to work on them. As the unMonastery model evolved, it became clear that the individual projects were impossible to manage, and were suffocating the main purpose of the experiment, which was to develop a prototype for a co-living and co-working space, based on ideas borrowed from monasticism. Eventually each of these projects transformed, proved to be not viable and was dropped, or  melted into even bigger collaborations. At the same time, little projects, lovingly named progettini, found us regularly. These proved to be closer to the reality that surrounded us, were people-friendly and insisted on our exposure as naive, clueless and/or helpless, but enthusiastic and eager to learn. They rendered us visible, momentarily comprehensible, and our case hopeful. On the other hand, our stakeholders had to have something to show in order to justify our funding, and justifiably, insisted on delivering the "projects", which we did, with varying depth. The general population, however, remained unimpressed.|


== 1.0 Delivering deliverables can evoke tunnel vision. == 

Community development projects cannot thrive in a sterile environment.  They have to be sown, to germinate and to take root before they can grow.  The juried project proposal system that sifts the pure genius from the less pure genius does just that; the proposed projects are descriptions of the applicant’s imagination.  Suddenly surrounded by reality, that same imagination should be encouraged to evolve something radically different.

Projects artificially supported by conceptual scaffolding can get all bad mannered and unruly in the face of reality. 

== 2.0 Our grand mission can get easily obscured by pressing immediate concerns. ==

While the way of the world encourages independence, performance and cleverness, we unMonasterians risk a quick extinction unless we employ human skills that foster camaraderie, generosity, and deep inter-reliance. 


== 3.0 I Progettini are the connective tissue of life in the project world: they are the conscious choices that align our availability and project our willingness to listen. == 

  
"//Massive projects can get heavy... **To counteract this the preferred project management device is the articulation of //sub-objectives// with which to illuminate the day to day occurrences which nourish the project environment.** In the unMo, part of this articulation is instinctive; however our grand mission can get easily obscured by pressing immediate concerns. So while the way of the world encourages independence, performance and cleverness, we unMonasterians risk a quick extinction unless we employ human skills that foster camaraderie, generosity, and deep inter-reliance.  Taking the time to articulate the need to cultivate these inner workings that support all our efforts is a vital step.  Our greater PROJECTS are to be constructed of more prosaic, daily **progettini**.//"
