====== Mining The Metaphor ======

"//From the moment of the first public voicing of the unWord at the LOTE#1((Living on the Edge, the Edgeryders'periodic congregations.)) gathering, exploring the imagery of the unMonastery has been a source of joy and inspiration.//"

== 1.0 The core idea attracted visionary extensions. ==

As we worked, readily transferable concepts and hierarchies clustered around our increasingly impressive conceptual edifice. We flirted with the attractive disciplines of poverty and penance, of the exertions of matins and vespers.  The unMonastery was to be our unPrecedented experimental workshop for building the Real Stuff.

|Associations with monasteries and with the "un" both proved to be fertile ground for the imagination. Two years in the making, the first unMonastery opened with the archives already full of soaring texts about its 200 years history and visionary future. In the 6 months of running the prototype, living up to the dreams of hackers, nomads and activists while delivering tangible results to a small town with a very real history, navigating the expectations of network science and South Italian social etiquette, defying both agile project management and historical negativity, proved to be a labyrinth in which we all got lost at various points.|
   


**The Parable of the Rubinetto** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/03/unmonastery-prototipo-matera/))

"My personal training as a performer was called upon from time to time.  It fell to me to script the prosaic parable of our existence as **the “Nozzle of the unMonastic Idea”** at our opening press conference.  This (visually evocative work demonstration) was adapted by popular demand for the Open House party as a prelude to a roof raising participatory ritual that revealed the depth of co-conspiracy that had brought us all together..."     

"//Clearly this essential tool (of the nozzle) resembled the unMonastery project.  The behind the scenes end that pried open the hose opening and wedged itself tenaciously fast with its concentric rings of teeth that root the whole operation in place, was clearly the committee that included the unMonasterani in their vision of social and cultural renewal. We ourselves were the working parts of the nozzle whose delicate interplay shaped the desired flow closer the more heralded front end.  Our noble task: to dispense a Fountain of Ideas at a rate most suited to the intended splash.  We were by nature finicky, but given sufficient attention to detail we could vary from an accelerated cleansing jet of significant pressure to a finely dispersed spray suitable for cultivation delicate growth.//"
   

== 2.0 A deeper question went unAnswered:  If we are not-pious, not-self-sacrificing, non-believers, how can we work very real miracles? == 



==== Conversation ====

//I have been reading about these language games.
I guess I sent you first to Wittgenstein's //Tractatus// which is this dead metaphysical construction. In the //Philosophical Investigations// he moves on to demonstrate how it is impossible to describe how language works in such a rigid logical system, and introduces the idea of language games.  The idea is that language is a "practice" we learn, not a double catalogue system between words and things.//

//Ah, of course - conversing is about twisting the constraints…//
22 mins
Bembo 

//… Playing with either new components, new combinations.
It has with the dominance of the unMon metaphor in our imaginations.  Our language was our liberation.//
22 mins
Bembo 


//I think it is relevant because where the Protocol and the cards provide necessary catalogues, your stories and coming commentaries will provide the "games" that will demonstrate the use of play.//
Katalin  22 mins

//We have taken a strong linguistic stance.
It is playful, evocative and ultimately dangerous.
Especially if we resist.//
21 mins  Bembo 

//Why dangerous?  The idea is that language is a "practice" that we occupy.//
Katalin • 20 mins

//It is dangerous because if forces us to take our dreams seriously. 
At its best, talking is an extreme sport.

//I am trying to understand how the construction of cards/Rules/Book will work
It will(should) help us design it better.//
Katalin • 18 mins

//Yes, it might. // "Faith Hope and Charity, and the greatest of these is Charity"// (Caritas = love/generosity?).
...
a biblical quote that sticks.  Of course, I was trying to get to **And the greatest of these is the Book.**   Then the unProtocol would be Faith, and the cards Hope, I'd suggest.
Tea's in the pot.//

//
OK I see your point. yes, the Book is what gives us the performative space to act, which is ultimately the goal of the entire unMon enterprise.  Do you remember when we did that divers' co-living exercise with Remy?//
Katalin • 13 mins

//ahem -- Instead of something highly desirable like sorting through the potential material for the GLO.(Greater and Lesser Omissions)book project?//
12 mins
Bembo 

//That exercise showed how easy it is to construct something (conceptual)- cards, protocol, etc. 
What is impossibly hard is to show how it is as a lived experience.

How can the Book be structured so it fits on the surface to the cards/Rules structure but opens it into this performative space?//
Katalin • 9 mins

//I'm thinking the Cards will evolve gracefully.  I am not worried about providing a cross reference system - it actually shan't require its own if the GLO is comprehensive.

The protocol is another question.  The history of the Benedictines is enlightening here.  Each monastery was charged with devising its own Rule.  I would suggest that we hold an //unSynod// - to propose a proposed protocol.  I struggled with the term, being more comfortable with unCode as it implied ethics and honour as well as just formulas.//

Bembo 


//So, the main question is, in our system of principles\evidences\interpretations where the performative space needs to open up.
You want (it seems) already at the level of evidences.
I am hesitating - maybe at the level of interpretations
(but I am solely looking at the practicality of the readership's attention span.)

Can we adopt your method of including photos with the texts and sometimes create this space with those?  A lot of people are visual.//
Katalin • 7 mins

//I think that 90% of the interactivity would manifest itself at the interpretation level.
To the degree people engage themselves at level II or even level I their contribution will be invisible.
To play a bit with your performative space.  This is not just where people can challenge but where they can be seen to be challenging.//
2 mins
Bembo 

//Yes.  Where the connections of a community appear.
and the reader witnesses our collective playing

so it becomes clear that it is people acting
(not acting like in theatre but acting like in ethics)
co-acting//
Katalin • Now

//I just hit the archive button -- where do the ghosts end up?//
Now • Bembo 

//I have no idea.
Shall we just copy and paste?//
