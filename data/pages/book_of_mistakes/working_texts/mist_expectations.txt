====== Expectations ======


**1.0  It is written somewhere in the unMo literature that projects are to be shattered upon arrival.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/27/it-is-written/))
    
"unMonasterians are by nature oppositional.  One doesn’t become a social activist by going mainstream.  Without taking grasp on this essential dynamic we floundered wildly.  While it was strategically necessary to define, refine and reinforce the project’s adherence to the margins, we, in a moderate case of culture shock, sought to meet **expectations**.  This could never fly."(("A Scribe's Notebook": under **In Quest of Marginality**))

|Expectations on behalf of stakeholders and unMonasterians were wildly different.  Was it a cheap and quick fix to deeply rooted historical, economical and social problems? Could it be a long-term engagement with specific communities, to produce meaningful work? Can we find in 4+2 months the recipe for delivering to all sides?|


"//Faced with relational difficulties, my instinct is to disinvest emotionally: we don't have to like each other to work together, we just need to respect each other, and respect needs to be encoded in concrete indicators – like we show up on time, we take good care of each other's work, we don't waste each other's time.//"((Alberto in ER platform letter to Bembo - https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11084#comment-11084))



=== 1.0 Bembo's Secrets for Actors: ===

  *   Secret #1 – Always be a human being.
  *   Secret #2 – Like the people you work with.

"//People come and stay because most of us wish to be a part of. Community, team, tribe. I strongly believe that, because I see it everywhere and also trust my own experience on that. That's why I stick to Edgeryders myself. Because I am  a part of. (I even believe *secretly, that it is not even a strong or clear idea which makes people come together, it is longing for being a part of, because it is deeply emotional, this is the beauty and a danger of it) And I'm a product of individualistic society, aren't we all, and will never find that paradise lost. I have seen non individualistic societies in action. I envy it, but at the same time it is scary and it's tough. It no morning practice, and no martyrdom. (I'm talking Southern Siberia, not social innovation smart villages). It is also for life, not for 3 month.//" (testimonial on the ER platform)
   
"//Despite all we may have heard to the contrary patience is not necessarily a Virtue.
Among my  personal disappointments is not taking a forceful stand for ‘what I know to be self-evident’; wishing that understanding grow from the dynamics of co-existence and that desirable choices evolve from logic rather than be unFurled from among my personal baggage.//" ((An early draft of ideas adhering to the productive april 2014 period of the Scribe.))

**2.0 This page should be filled by commentary from all generations of unMoaners: perhaps the idealistic texts from each of our initial project proposal documents...**


"**EXCEPTIONALLY FRUITFUL MEETING IN MATERA**: //...The launch was not the feared long-winded cutting of a ribbon featuring endless toasts with increasingly power-sapping vino.  It was something very much more potent: a strategically recruited constellation of citizens with a common will to realise their dreams for their community.  Judging by the tangible energy generated by the mapping process, they have every chance of succeeding…

If I try to recall my assumptions as to what I suspected would become the imposition of the greatest hits of a collective //Edgeryder// vision upon a rather unsuspecting community, our proposal seemed admittedly fragile beforehand.  The revelation during this meeting was that which I imagined would operate as 'an isolated hacker embassy spouting foreign ideas', is far from an action of imperialism or evangelism.
We won’t be walking into endless confrontations with non-comprehending locals.

...it is clear that a sufficiently diverse group of people are primed, hungry and engaged in making our presence a vital catalyst.  The imported //Edgeryders// will not be fighting for attention, we will be quickly coming in contact with a vibrant group of people eager to run with whatever relevant stimulus they may derive from our presence.//"  ((blog notes after March '13 Meet the unMonastery Gathering at Mediateca, Matera.))

"//This was a defensive position, perhaps understandable, but far from reality.  Blinded by the bad PR given troglodyte cave-persons by a globalised popular culture, it was hard to surmise that the opposite is closer to the truth.  It should be no surprise that a city with a 9000 year old history supports layers of civilized human interaction that might put the cultural environment in say, Bergen, the merely 1000 year old city in which I live, to shame.//"
