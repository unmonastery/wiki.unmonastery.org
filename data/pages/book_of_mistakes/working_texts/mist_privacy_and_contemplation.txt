====== Privacy and Contemplation ======

|In the unMonastery Matera prototype, there was very limited time for contemplation, learning and reflexion. The time frame simply did not allow for it.|

"Living in the unMonastery is an intense community experience. As a prototype, we decided to have an invisibility hat that a person can put on to create intense privacy if necessary. The others will act as if you were not there if you wear it. The table will not be laid for you, you will not be talked to, basically your presence will be ignored. This is an untried prototype, just like cleaning." ((from the [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gEzm3x3PCmENtscZTr1afhAw8XsQJW_lbbhnSheJjrA/edit|unMonastery integration package]]))
