====== Prehistory ======


//**In the Beginning there was the Council of Europa**  
And the Council of Europa begat the Office for Social Cohesion Research and the Office for Social Cohesion Research begat the Early Warning Division and they begat Edgeryders.  And the Edgeryders begat LOTE#1 Strasbourg, and LOTE#1 Strasbourg begat the unConference and the unConference begat the Conversation.  And Lo and Behold the conversation begat the unMonastery.  And they were much amazed.


And the LOTE#1 Strasbourg begat LOTE#2 Bruxelles and the LOTE#2 begat the Gathering of the Experts, and the Gathering of the Experts begat the Lore of the unMonastery.  And the Lore of the unMonastery did cause the Comitato di Matera 2019 to quiver.  And together they did beget the Mediateca Meeting of the Community, and the Mediateca Meeting with the Community begat the Multitudinous Challenges.  And the Challenges begat LOTE#3 Matera and LOTE#3 Matera begat the 200 Year History.  And the 200 Year History begat //The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions//.  And they were sore afraid.  And the Challenges begat the Projects; and the Projects begat the unMonastery Prototipo Matera. And the unMonastery Prototipo Matera begat *Il Libro degli Errori*.// ((Here writes KH on the Fallacy of the Connection between dream and creation.))   
     

==Those Upstarts==   
      

**1.0 The recipe is elegant.  Skilled but critical human citizens turn their back on the inhuman marketplace to move into surplus public real estate at the outer edge of the modern experiment.  Together they recreate almost forgotten life rhythms and devise meaningful work projects. They are not here to thrash out miracles ((More on miracles [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist-un|here]])), but can inadvertently find themselves bestowing their blessings upon those who mirror similar values.  This installation of committed workers into a local community where hope and vision may be suffering, can act as a catalyst.  Alliances will be formed; spin-off can be anticipated…** ((Nota bene, this was written before opening the doors of the unMonastery Matera prototype.))  
      
|The unMonastery existed in concept two years before it was first tried on the ground. A desire for clarity of goals and expectations existed from the beginning. What was the role of the "challenges" of a small South Italian city and the "projects" proposed to address them? How would they be compatible with the idea of creating social cohesion through slow albeit committed work, radical thinking, and elements of play?|   


Three Edgeryders were about to descend upon Matera for the first time. Our hosts sought to ease our arrival and generate local curiosity. Ilaria sent out a questionnaire penned by Carlo; she received one answer :   
    
//"Dear Carlo Magni,     
      
  It is very good to have a name to talk with.  Just talking about dreams without a real person there, is nowhere near as satisfactory… The same is true for the project as a whole; all my experience tells me that the ideas and the fantasy are just to get you to the starting place; once you actually begin, you have to return to zero and build upon reality. Is it therefore possible that I don't answer your questions at all?  - a naughty boy boycotting the exchange out of fear of building an intellectual construct that at best can only be a shadow of reality. Instead, I offer the following statement of belief:  this project smells as if it has all the correct ingredients ready to be put into place. ((Apart from the fact that only one out of the original 6 unMonasterians spoke Italian. One is forced to wonder about failing to realise how important communication was going to be to realise the lofty plans.))  A space for a sustained human meeting, basic needs met or meetable, a community of people who expect that they will find good work and inspiration in each others company.  Solving all of the practical questions before hand, is not desirable; it is through this solving in cooperation that the unique character of the unMonastery will develop…    But, that said, here we go at the Here we go:  

**In what way Matera's characteristics meet the objectives of the unMonastery?**  — the ground feeling behind the unMon idea is that the Edgeryder group has potentially more to do with each other outside of meeting halls, and closer to real life.  Anchoring this real life in a real community is utterly logical.  One of our main desires is to be adept at adapting to diverse host communities;  the selection of Matera has seemed an organic process –  as we are developing our prototype ((Prototype = our favourite word)), it will prove a worthy dialog partner no matter what Matera's strengths or weaknesses may be —  a imperfect community that welcomes us and is eager to see us succeed.
   
**What are the needs that have been foreseen for the city of Matera by the unMonastery team?**
We talk about several issues: internally we have to create a viable living rhythm that enables us to research the unMo life form, we can then turn out to absorb the qualities of potential interaction with the community at large.  We know that some of the outcomes of our stay should be tangible and lasting: before having started it is not only difficult to say what these may be; it may also be dangerous.  To say that 'we wish to give', before finding out who we are, and therefore what we have to give – is not the best personnel management style.  Each unMon will have its own core group, and then incorporate a stream of visiting contributors  – each of these shall be encouraged to listen to the greater community in their own way.    


**What should the people of Matera expect from the project and in what way can they be part of it?** In my opinion, we have been thinking a bit narrowly about the project – ideally I reason we should be there for three years:  year one - we map out the territory, and invent our magnificent ancient traditions; year two - serious work builds towards some impressive creations; year three - the jobs of the unMonks and unNuns get taken over by resident Materani.  //Are the Materani expecting miracles, do they have a history of being disappointed by Northerners, might they wish to join in the work?// The specifics lie in the specific projects.   


**What do the unMonasterians expect from the city of Matera and its inhabitants?** We sincerely hope that you will be yourselves:  good, caring hosts.  You are also encouraged to be typical human beings: and give us your impatience, minor bureaucratic tendencies, forgetfulness and other aspects of human imperfection; it is only by you being a busy, multifaceted urban environment that we will have to learn how unMonasteries develop our characteristic strategies for survival in the face of such reality.   

**There is an ongoing discussion in Matera regarding the possibility of becoming a place that fosters “creativity tourism”: the donation of ideas and visions coming from changemakers that come to the city and are hosted with the aim of starting and developing projects in the city of Matera. Do you think that Matera can be such a place?**

Please, we have to be there first.  If Matera does indeed have a unique set of resources for building a visionary community, we can be a good indicator as to this being possible.     

**What are the next steps for the launch of the unMonastery? When will we start seeing unMonasterians walking around the city?**

The launch will provide a dash of concrete stimulus to a few of us — We have yet to formally recognise the desirability of having a distinguishing unMon clothing style that would indeed enable you to spot us immediately.  I am thinking long kilts, at least for the men. ((I (Alberto) know Carlo Magni, and I'm guessing he probably felt Bembo was either eluding questions or mocking him! What was the reaction?))
