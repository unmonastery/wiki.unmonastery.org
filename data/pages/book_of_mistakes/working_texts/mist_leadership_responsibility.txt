====== Leadership & Responsibility ======

|The unMonastery inherited the Edgeryders' slogan: //"whoever takes the leadership is calling the shots"//. Initially, this harsh way of operating was softened by our circle culture: we talked about our plans, shared concerns, and made decisions together. Once the circles were dropped, individual initiatives occasionally landed the whole group in trouble. It also failed to work on the meta-level, with regard to the unMonastery. We had no rules, and being a horizontal organisation, we had no way to take action against individuals or tendencies that were clearly eroding the community.|

== 4.7 Support the leadership, not by virtue of being leadership but because they are doing their best in a vulnerable position. ==  

Implied, but not stated is that 'leadership' needn't be hierarchical and the term could be synonymous with initiative.  However this then brings up the question of strategy:  could this introduce with plenty of details: the abandoned bi-weekly parties, the project presentations, the Pisolino Libero Escapade, even Mapping the Commons.
