=====Scriptorium - Living in your Laptops=====

|Documentation was always to be key. Not only our stakeholders, both the Comitato and the Edgeryders, required that we make our activities visible, or that it was in our best interest to nurture our global connections while finding our footing on the ground, but the first unMonastery served as a prototype to create a model for future unMonasteries. Since it was difficult to deduce in the middle of things what would emerge as important, it was best to record everything. On the other hand, despite the obsessive production of virtual proof that we exist and get things done, some key aspects of the unMonastery ideal proved to be unrecordable. Ultimately, our projects ended up existing in the form of websites and blog posts, shared documents and reports to our stakeholders. It turned out to be against the nature of friendship and the logic of physical community to include in our reports the friendships and alliances we each built in Matera, to reveal in-house conflicts, burn-out enhancing habits and unHabits, doubts, personal loss of faith, or even reportage of amazement. The tangible relief when we got something done and could sit down to have dinner was simply impossible to translate into a report, just as discord and tension was too personal to include.|

**1.0  Despite the purported advantage provided by their mastery of an impressive array of TLA ((Three Letter Acronyms)), it remains highly unlikely that the Geeks shall inherit the Earth.** ((Natalya was not aware of the Building Manual and had no idea when the garbage should be taken out, and how to sort it. I sent it to her, and we will set everything up, but it will have to be reconsidered, how it is possible to manage better the building. She had to call Rita each time there was a problem, which is not a very effective way to do this when all the information has been stored on Trello cards etc. -- Katalin H., report to unMonastery group, 05.10.14.))

Communication is not one way.   Listening with attention only gets you so far.    Without the intent of anchoring each thought somewhere within reasonable reach of the soul of those to whom you are addressing, words flutter in the firmament.** 



=== The Myth of Send ===

 Where once there was the singular Word : to be studied and illuminated, committed to memory and then ceremoniously regurgitated in song, we are now surrounded by hyper-text.  The historian’s cleft between oral and written sources has become widened by the void of the unopened e-mail.  ((In a landscape where near and far sit perched at their several scriptoriums for more hours a day than is healthy, there is no reassurance that that which has been posted has ever been taken to heart. In this atmosphere, our careful crafting of the Word far exceeds an equivalent care in the consumption of even that which is minted specifically for us.  **Can we please find a Ben who routinely moans about the backlog in his over-stuffed in-box while admonishing his followers for not digesting his every pronouncment? It would slide in most tellingly here.** )) 

In the aftermath of an offering of ‘Guerilla Shakespeare’ where even the noblest of language had a tendency to soar without purpose, unMonastery-watcher Dougald Hine offered this anecdote: //"as an eight year old schoolchild, he had unearthed a pressing concern. Studying the pioneers of space travel, one page was dedicated to Laika, the first ever cosmonaut. What caught young Dougald’s discerning sense of narrative was that there was no mention of the dog returning to earth. With his science teacher’s encouragement he drafted a letter to a professor of Astronomy to confirm his worse suspicions. No, indeed the desiccated remains of Laika may orbit the stratosphere to this very day."//  (( This post-mortem continues rather petulantly in words that are not by any means Dougald's:  //"Had these young actors been brought up with a similar quasi scientific approach? Was there a pervasive false idea that projecting the words out into space is enough to make the story occur in the hearts and minds of the audience? That given enough propulsion the words themselves will then tell their own story? Had no one taught them that grounding the text in one’s own real time experience, and making all effort to assure that they land somewhere safely within your fellow actors, is the most vital part of a successful mission?//

Monasteries do words.  In the beginning they are built upon //the Big One//.   Copying, preserving, illuminating and reciting centuries of sacred text for the benefit of the //Souls of the Future//.  With the stability (sic) of an internet hookup, the earliest unMoaners found person to person meeting circles less attractive.  While this can be statistically verified, the direct causality is the subject of conjecture.  It appears that instead of elaborating before the loving bosom of the group upon the strategic concerns supporting ones planned activities, it was enough to e-post your schemes into the collective ether.  The presumption then held that everyone was 'fully informed'.((The House Scribe himself appears equally guilty.  Cowardly allowing his precious insight and flagrant //bons mots// to get //blogged down// in the swamp of his excessive verbiage, his talents went all hid under a barrel like.  It is speculated that his penchant for circumlocution may have habitually confused the baroque for a version of diplomacy.  In any case, the distinct literary merit of his texts clearly obscures their true value.  Despite a growing band of international followers, anecdotal evidence suggests that few in the house ever read the things. While the heartfelt pleas of his fellow co-livers would extract such after-dinner ‘desserts’ as ad hoc film synopses, play readings, songs and an ill-fated public dream interpretation session, a weekly //"Parole della Voce Narrante della Casa"// was not conceived until well after the institution of Closing Circle was abandoned in tatters by busy evenings of the social whirl.))
