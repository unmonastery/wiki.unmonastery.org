====== Follow-up ======

|One of the unforeseen challenges for the unMonastery prototype was the difficulty to understand the structure of communication and trust in Matera, so different from the unMonasterians' individual experience. Openness about our activities had to go beyond "making them available" - by making it very visible, inviting, and accessible. During the 6 months we had too little time to create the tradition of an unMonastery schedule of regular, returning series of events, which would have allowed people to spread the word, bring friends, and build credibility.|
  

"//It was wisely remarked that the Una Giornata nel Piccianello events went off in the wrong order.  At some point the idea was to incorporate the children’s event within the Saturday — separating it out to give it undivided attention was another good move.  Had we, however, staged the children’s event first, it would have helped to draw the children’s parents to the market day; completing the circle through the generations would have been a beautiful achievement.//" ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))
   
**1.0 Our unDeniable accomplishment of becoming a spiritual home for cranks and visionaries and elements of the local post-student drinking classes may be secured; but it is far from given that this converts into meaningful fieldwork.  Follow-up is everything.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/20/il-livro-dell-errori-ii/))
   
"Our way out of this is to go into our circles, to distill our desirables via a collective process that masks our personal ambition and elevates the inherent vision to a function of the group.  If I were to humbly suggest **tentative project virtues** that might help us unMonasterians align our day to day work, a brief list might look like this:

  * **participatory** — leave behind the experience of doing the work;
  * **visceral** — incorporate the joy of physical effort at that core of the exchange;
  * **inhabit a linguistically level (or lower) playing field**;
  * **elegant** — in accomplishment and idea;
  * **demonstrative of the creation of surplus value**
