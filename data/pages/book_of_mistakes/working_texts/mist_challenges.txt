====== Challenges ======   


|The financial formula for the first unMonastery was the following: in exchange for food and shelter from their host community, unMonasterians deliver their proposed projects that were selected to solve((By using the measure of '//solved//' this falls into the most common trap of community development analysis: issues are to be //addressed//.  Any solutions must involve embedding experiential elements of empowerment into local co-workers by which the community experience not just change, but the culture of precipitating this change. )) specific problems.   In Matera known as - the Challenges.|


**1.0 The unMon travels on its challenges; we are where we are because we have skills to lend to our host community.**  (( "This turned out to be a much more complex picture. Upon arrival: we learned that the primary reason to fund the unMonastery was to open up the city to Europe and European experts, as part of the city's bid for Cultural Capital of Europe in 2019. Not only did the city at large not identify with the list of 12 challenges, but even the group of citizens working on the bid were considered outsiders. Meanwhile, the development of the unMonastery as a co-living and co-working model to revitalise recession-stricken Europe was the priority for the Edgeryder community who participated in creating the concept of the unMonastery and negotiated the financial and physical aspects of the deal. Ideals collided with reality; although the challenges were never taken particularly seriously by either party, in the end, they turned out to be the only measure to evaluate the experiment: whether they were solved or not. )) (( touchy stuff: You get rather harsh and far up the road of us being a disaster.  I think 'literally' rather than 'seriously'.   (I don't know where it has got to, but the conclusion of our ritual burning of the 12 challenges was that each of them had indeed been honestly explored.(should be from Ben.  We also need to frame the 12 challenges as cleansed or distilled.) )) 

"Historically, the establishment of a monastery could often involve an element of imposition.  A recently installed warring feudal lord with a hearts and minds problem on his hands would contrive to import a favoured monastic order to sweeten the new deal.  The monasteries were built to deliver.   There remained this thing about the general Glory of God, but what was that in Euros?  If their extracted taxes must be hammered into acres of gold leaf, the good people demanded their [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_the_unabbots|fair share of miracles]]...    
    
Monks had recipes; they did brewing, distilling, medicinal herbs.  Their international contact network gave them access to both ancient knowledge and technological innovation.   While on the surface they were to provide spiritual guidance, they often had a hidden agenda which rattled the balance between local political factions as competing brotherhoods in each their edifice performed rites around which their benefactors could anchor the status quo.  

In addition, the traditional monasteries supplied other social services.  A primary function was population control.  Siphoning off an uncertain percentage of the surplus production and absorbing the human sub-caste of spirit wanderers and sexual minorities to render them if not out of harm's way, at least literate.  People approved.   In exchange the monks and nuns ministered to the ailing, kicked up periodic cultural events and generally spread the Good Word.  Any attendant whiff of a miracle was rapidly thrust into the eager hands of the PR department..."  

 
|On March 23, 2013 a public town meeting was held at the Mediateca, Matera.  Citizens gave their input about the problems they experience within the town. A year later, the MT2019 committee had established a home for The unMonastery.  11 unMonasterians arrived to bravely solve/address these “challenges”.|  
**2.0 Written records indicate that one of the core elements of practice that enabled the earliest unMonasterians to successfully expand and replicate their triumphs was (the spirit of) //le Capatoste//**  (("Roughly translatable as ‘the Hardheads’, the guiding principle of //cappatosta// proved key to the installation of the first four-month iteration of the unMo at Matera.  In turn, generous amounts of  this ‘applied stubbornness’ allowed several of the first unMonks to refuse to digest the conceptual constraints of this time limit.  Living and waking in rocks, time is not fleeting – permanence permeates.  We stand 'stabile'. Alterations which would otherwise inevitably be earthshaking, are absorbed in geological time." http://bembodavies.com/2014/02/20/il-libro-delgli-errori/  
( The term capatosta may have been the first Italiano that I learned at the joyous occasion of the opening press conference; hearing a conspiratorial //brindisi// (toast) shared between the unMonastery's three Rs: Rita Orlando, Raffaella Pontrandolfi and Rossella Tarantino, the three women who put in the day-to-day effort to make the floating unMon idea land in the fertile earth of Matera.  - BD.  ) ))  **and their willingness to embrace their disasters.** 


|The Challenges became our greatest liability. Were we to deliver our projects as 'solutions', they were being developed with minimal (or completely without) local participation due to the extremely short time frame. Were we not to deliver anything, we were a waste of money. The local press advertised the arriving unMonasterians as near-superheroes. Our PR guaranteed our fall from grace even before we started.| 

    

**Scripting the infamous 12 Challenges** (([[http://matera.unmonastery.org/en/challenges]]))
    
"The evolution of the certified Challenges of the Matera Prototype unMonastery involved a beautiful event of engaged citizen participation.  Afterwards, spirits were high.  It was confidentially mentioned that the eagerness to come to terms with collective concerns seemed to reflect such a high degree of commitment that this meeting itself may have been sufficient catalyst, and the establish of a unMonastery an non-essential luxury. However, despite the positive atmosphere generated the document that emerged listing 46 core concerns was fundamentally flawed. It was couched in predominately negative language.


**4.0 The entire set-up of the non-Monastero was based upon false premises.  The original forty-three challenges ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/challenges-on-the-ground-unmonastery-in-matera)) extracted from the Materani almost exactly a year ago, were unfortunately never properly recorded.**((Also know as the '47 complaints'... each of them was based around a perceivable element of [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_negativity|negativity]]: 21 examples of the word “No”, supplemented by 5 “Nots”, and the very telling sentence://"La gente si lamenta molto."// People complain a lot. http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/05/il-livro-dell-errori-iii/  This was operatically explored by Brother Bembo in his Opening Ceremony presentation of the //'Culture First'// approach to community development work. http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/25/creative-deconstruction/ )) ((The best they could manage was a good-tempered summary – a renovated, more palatable 'Greatest Hits' now routinely presented as //"the twelve desirable desires"// and circulated to the international curious.)) (("Slowly the balance shifted towards significance. A thinking soul had removed from their place on the unMon wall illuminated graphic renditions of **“//The Twelve Challenges//”**. As discussed ad nauseam elsewhere ( link to video ) these baulderised //‘statements of intent’// had been awarded an unDeserved position of leverage in the unMonastery mythology. Those who had witnessed their origin as rewrites of a longer list of sorrowful wails, cringed when the effort to outfit each challenge with a designer quality individual logo had only helped carve something in figurative stone that hadn’t actually a genuine root in the community they sought to represent. The current observation was that these pumped-up objectives were too much a millstone for the unMonastery’s **“Experti di Niente”**( //Experts at Nothing// as the unMonasterians were dubbed in a widely circulated newspaper article that criticised the MT2019 initiative and which mocked the Pisolino Libero project. July 2014.) They (the false challenges - ed.) would best be burnt to avoid them falling into the wrong hands; anyone resuming our good works should be free of the these falsely inflated expectations." [[http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/19/inventing-tradition/]]))    
     
Before going international it was necessary to perform a whitewash.  Behind the scenes a sub-committee of stakeholders held a small session of corrective surgery that compressed the cumbersome list of lamentations into a palatable catalog of concerns((This was, in hacker parlance, "a feature, not a bug". The idea was to create a context for interaction between the unMonasterians and the city: "Why should I talk to you? What can we talk about?" "Well, we can talk about the challenges and how we address them!". The social contract between MT2019 and Edgeryders was always: a building *and a social role*. This was fully embedded in the city's collective intelligence strategy for 2019. See [[http://www.cottica.net/2013/04/03/the-road-to-the-unmonastery-three-low-cost-moves-towards-becoming-a-smart-community/|The road to the unMonastery: three low-cost moves towards becoming a smart community]], April 2013 )). These were circulated without comment and the world was none the wiser:   

     
//** "These challenges represent the primary focus for projects submitted to the first prototype of unMonastery in Matera 2014 and were compiled from [[https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/challenges-on-the-ground-unmonastery-in-matera|this earlier larger list]] with the help of those living in Matera.** //
    
     
1) Significant lack of offline engagement or visibility for happenings throughout the city.  
   
It was indicated that contributing factors are a lack of digital literacy and no centralised place to find out what's happening in the city.   
    
2) Lack of a inter-generational space   
   
This challenge can be understood and compacted by a series of other challenges that were previously highlighted; No space for children, No place for ‘Citizens’ (in that many of the spaces which do exist are not run by participants), No important roles for young people in business or decision making processes, No volunteer or altruistic culture from young and Old people have nothing to do.    
   
3) Lack of a space for children focused on developing skills, specifically technology   
    
4) Lack of security knowledge    
    
Pio Acito highlighted that there exists no early warning systems around or risk analysis within the local population for unforseen future crisis. This could be considered within the context of food security, energy security and naturally occurring risk management.    
   
5) Lack of a global view on the city    
    
This is an issue that has been repeated throughout the sessions we've run, because the Sassi is so beautiful tourism and attention is always paid to this area to the detriment of the rest of the city. An additional challenge previously highlighted that's relevant to this is the ability only to attract international tourism instead of those from the local region.    
    
What would tourism look like if you tours were not centralised around the Sassi?    
    
6) Lack of philanthropy and general inability on the part of many to raise funds    
    
7) Lack of accessible mobility for disabled people    
    
8) Lack of waste management    
     
Poor infrastructure and literally no recycling. During our first co-design session a number of responses were highlighted in the way this could be handled or approached: Develop a wider understanding for a new waste narrative; from the shit of the dogs, to the whole of the waste cycle. Create greater transparency for the infrastructure that affects citizen’s lives through mapping exercises - Waste System Analysis - Of Existing System - Utilising tracking of waste. Introduction of composting    
    
9) Renewable Energies    
    
Because currently there are none.    
    
10) Water Systems and Sustainability    
    
Water Extraction Techniques - Matera has a history and database of many existing processes, how could these be translated, built upon and potentially open sourced and redeployed as an intellectual export of Matera? Potential for developing new water catching techniques    
    
11) Many houses and buildings are not in use and there is no architectural innovation.    
    
This issue is at the core of the unMonastery model and the project in and of itself seeks to solve this problem by creating a new kind of space in buildings that would otherwise remain unused, it may though be interesting to think about how unMonastery can influence and leverage the use of other unused spaces.    
     
12) There is no system (offline and online) where you can see the timetable and routes of public transport! > distances in Basilicata are different from big cities > 30 mins look like long distances."(("The way it (the distillation of community challenges) was done is contradictory to the entire process: you "offer" people the opportunity to attend a meeting (entering a foreign space) and assume they have the audacity to voice what they might even consider dissent.  
For me, that's putting voices in a position of vulnerability, why not take an ethnographic approach while utilising Lauren's open dinner approach? Go out and take the position of vulnerability by entering the domains of power of the citizens?  Go to dinner at their houses, go for tea, go to places of informal congregation and register complaints and lauding. 
Do not invite people into structures of power to get their opinion, you're inviting oppositional behaviour, a binary of leader and lead.  Instead seek or create neutral spaces to elicit needs of people,  this should take no longer than a month to compile and cross reference to find common themes to *then* have validated by citizenry.
