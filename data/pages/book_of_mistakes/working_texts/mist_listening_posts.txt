====== Listening posts  ======

|The unMonastery model in Matera implied that there was a stakeholder in town, a group who pledged to be our supporters and promoters, but to whom we also needed to deliver. However, the unMonastery ideal was to serve the hosting city, and not a single political entity. Our official channels of information bing unAvoidably partial, we needed to develop ways to be able to listen to other voices in the community. The ingenious ways we experimented with were not always without controversy, however, they greatly contributed to enhancing our visibility in town. Nota bene, listening developed to be a key feature of being an unMonasterian, and the culture to create listening posts inevitable.|


"//We unMonasterians were visible around the edges, but had purposely kept in the background while the hour had unfolded.  It generated precisely the kind of event that we all long for…//" ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))

== 1.0 Tweaking the expressions of the collective consciousness is at best invasive.  Social anthropology shall observe, not fiddle with the DNA of cultural reproduction.  Designing tradition may be the world of the unMonastery or the Institute for Non-toxic Propaganda but it invites confrontation…  As with the work of Jungian Sandplay Therapy, to maneuver what is essentially the stuff of dreams before the glaring light of conscious choice is to take responsibility for shaping one’s history. ==

"//As the Christs, doves, and cherubim clenched in the fists of the greedy are broadcast to all, one would anticipate this disgusting lack of fair play would provoke instant disapproval.  Not so; in an orgy of reverse schadenfreude the crowd erupt in a surprising roar for the home team.  A cloud of testosterone fired by the scent of the prey expresses great vicarious glee at the successful pillage.//" ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/07/14/deconstructing-the-bruna-ritual-police-brutality/))

== 2.0 He focused on changing hearts and minds - not through preaching but through artistically creative strategies that employed the power of individual and community disapproval.  ==

"//Unfortunately I have neither the time or the will to be polite, so let me be rude and say that I'm asking you to stop your creative performances. it is not because I don't appreciate creativity and jokes. What I really DON'T appreciate is that this is happening under the unMonastery umbrella: there are people who have been working hard (and they have committed their lives) for the success of the project that also means  to tell to citizens that we're not a bunch of squatters and to demonstrate that THEIR money (your money comes from citizens duties, did you know?) have been used for something meaningful.//" ((from an email to the unMon mailing list))

"//I think my original proposal clearly stated the intentions of my presence here: to create temporal autonomous nodes of social interaction where intergenerational interactions can take place in a neutral and safe liminal space of mutual vulnerability (i.e. openness) which enhances dialogue and exchange.

The intended result was to generate some curiosity on the part of Materani that are not using social media (i.e.: the majority) in order to connect via this theatrical form of urban outreach, and I must say, it was a success. A success in that many people who know nothing of what unMonastery is doing now had a chance to ask us questions and have projects explained to them which might very well apply to them and facilitate their lives.     
   
As far as attaining tangible results, as was stated in my original proposal, I think our (albeit short-lived) project has disseminated ongoing projects further into the public mindset and many meaningful exchanges were had between participants in the experiment. Will this raise awareness of the value and importance of unMonastery among the common people? It's too soon to tell, but it really can't have done any harm as we did spread news of the ReStart classes and various other projects.//" ((from an email to the unMon mailing list)) (("The distribution of knowledge is the key contemporary task," Mockus said. "Knowledge empowers people. If people know the rules, and are sensitized by art, humor, and creativity, they are much more likely to accept change." - http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/03.11/01-mockus.html))

===Language is Metaphor=== 
"Language does not do more than reflect reality.  A small percentage may be rooted in concrete relationships, but it (a choice of words) is by nature subjective.  Someone is doing the talking; using general indications of private association glued together by convention.  The imprecision potentially surrounding our conversation is vast, but it is held together by a deep human need to comprehend.  We pro’jéct our understanding because we are dependent upon understanding:  //  What you says goes.//

**The Admonition of the Opening Circle **  

The key opening sentence that formally accompanied the unMonastery circles was instructive: //“Speak with intention, and Listen with attention.”//...  To speak and to listen are higher human functions.   They are not the same as to say and hear.  If the core project of the unMonastery is to find and maintain any available balance as the foundation for a functional hub of community service, short cuts in the listening and speaking process are perilous..."  ((This residual note continues most cryptically in what only can be characterised as a snippet: //The residents of any projected unMoanastery are odd people with an inevitable gene-pool of quirky behaviour.  By nature we are alarmed, concerned and conscious that we bear the brunt of the modern experiment.  No matter how much we fancy our efforts as a very human default setting for the over-educated hordes of the 'Unemployed Youth of the Earth', the unMo is a fall-back retreat position.  Long may it keep up its good work. ))
