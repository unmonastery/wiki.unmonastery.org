====== Hazards ======


Seasons and waves are a function of time. Arriving at the unMo in times of plenty it is perhaps impossible to intuit times of sparsity. The healthy pantry of March doesn’t reflect the empty cupboards of February. What was once a miracle, can easily be taken for granted. Similarly, it may be difficult for survivors of 'the cold water days' to believe that the self-evident is not self-evident.((Deprivation and the Deprived - The Tyranny of the unRuly))

**While the way of the world encourages independence, performance and cleverness, we unMonasterians risk a quick extinction unless we employ human skills that foster camaraderie, generosity, and deep inter-reliance.**

**Delivering deliverables can evoke tunnel vision.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/27/it-is-written/))

|In the first month of the unMonastery we evolved from a group of strangers into a well-functioning family. Our traditions of sharing thoughts and meals and a structure of the day created a strong-knit community. The growing in-house difficulties - new arrivals, new voices, new doubts -, and various outside pressures, resulted in letting go of some of the habits, for example the habit of listening. This in turn led to people in distress feeling isolated, and either leaving or turning strictly to focusing on projects. There was a shift, where the group became a struggling team of project managers instead of a sharing community. This led to stress, burn-out, disappointment and unhappiness.|

"To attempt to balance upon this our belovéd //un// was an act of hubris.  We are what we are, not what we strive not to be.  To miracle or not to miracle, is not at all the question - the demand for miracles was inevitable. It would be the implicit ghost that would haunt our small mortal efforts unDauntedly.  Yes, there were triumphs, some major, but weren't they too inevitable?  Good brains, working damn hard were bound to come up with something; these could hardly be classified as earth-shattering.  At best while they would  appease the faithful, they would unDeniably fail to convert the sceptical.

The other //un// to follow us was the specter of discipline.  Being **unDisciplined** was hardly a selling point.  By not supplying anything firmer to embrace upon arrival than a collection of musing, we unConsciously pursued a path of mediocrity.  Our commitments could be unQualified and unInhibited as long as they were commitments to that which remained unDetermined..." (late post-unMon notes - BD)




**The inherent conflict between our existence as a willing service institution and the more central experiment as a lifestyle choice is now under trial.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/24/the-healing-arts/))

**A Structural Foible ?**
//A crisis meeting with our local sponsors the MA2019 Comitato spawned an actionable actionable: the architect's sub-group would appraise the 'physical state of the building' within two days.  The in-house Scribe piped up; he would produce a parallel document about the 'psychic state of the inhabitants' within the same time frame.  Oddly, this was to be the last administrative meeting to which he would be invited...//

====“An Emotional Report – The unMonastery 23 days====
The unMonastery Prototype Matera started with at least one tremendous advantage. The initial crew of unMonasterians that slid through the recruitment process and landed pounding at the gates, were a super selection of adult human beings.  With small variations in individual strong points, we proved willing and able to exhibit understanding and patience in the face of several frustrating factors.  Not only was not every last detail in place for the theoretical Feb.1st moving-in-day, but several key systems exhibited signs of cantankerousness within days of the upstart.  Faced with this quirky beginning, our crowd showed themselves to be generous, creative and not the least, flexible.  Our working principle was soon articulated as //‘We Trust in the Process’.//

It was no doubt preordained that as an unmonastic order ‘unaided by precedence’ we would be fated to //compose tradition// ((see [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_inventing_traditions|Inventing Tradition]])) as it became necessary.  However, to serenely surrender to the prototype variant of our Vow of Poverty has prompted some heroic effort.  In his characteristically flowery opening speech at the inaugural press conference, our belovéd committee chairperson Paolo Verri seemingly waxed on a bit about giving us life-stimulating //‘difficulties’//.  Some of us may have hoped that these collective difficulties had been a little less thorough, but it is through living the ‘interesting times’ of our first days that we as novices have built the foundation of our unSister/unBrotherhood.
The inevitable structural disappointments may have been tailor-made for fertilising our prototype.  They have demanded that we begin at a conceptual zero; abandoning our dreams to build upon reality as it has presented itself.  **This embracing of on-the-ground real world is a central key to good project design.  It requires a willingness to leave behind the rhetoric of the project proposal and build one’s work in situ  — one human contact at a time.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))   
    
**Keeping the Faith**      
We shrunk. It happens to all of us.  Our genius adapts to reality.  Once we hit the vast field of the work, we get dwarfed.  In an unComfortable situation,  seeking more discomfort is counter-intuitive.  Life has taught us to accept limits, we become tamed by our circumstances.  When our renewables aren’t renewed by our discipline, our vision blurs. Sister Katalin was brutal:  “What did you do to my beloved unMonastery?”  ((One of the first in the door she juggled family commitments to stretch her two short stints into three.  -  “In my eyes you are all heretics because you totally ruined the rituals that defined the unMonastery for me.”))
