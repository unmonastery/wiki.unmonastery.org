====== Psychic Balance ======


**1.0 Our renewal mechanisms are reduced to bad jokes, genuine caring and pure human warmth as shared in our two daily ritual circles and the universal sacrament of mealtimes.**((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/24/the-healing-arts/))

//"Have we ridden dangerously into the forest of burnout? Yes, indeed.  It remains to be seen if we have the balancing skills to negotiate ourselves beyond the feeling that we are stuck in the establishment phase."//  ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))

"//Human beings seek the normal: our parasympathetic nervous systems are rigged to de-fuse stress.  Building a social organ that calms the agitated being also seems a natural endeavor for a collective organism.//"  ((BD orphan))


|The unMonastery model is based on a balance between personal and community well-being, and individual and collaborative work. As a group, we struggled to manage internal and external expectations. Inevitably, the structure that included individual projects made us pull in different directions; differences in the comprehension of what teamwork entailed resulted in the partial breakdown of the group, Serious burnout resulted.|



**3.0 Perhaps we secretly know we are still negotiating an impossible balancing act, but several things have lifted the spirits...** ((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11084#comment-11084 )) 


"//Thanks for the Challenge Alberto.
I would say that we unMos offer no path to FastLove, but without a well-oiled way to //‘renewable frugal joy’// we cannot build the necessary core to sustain our community.  The project hardware is accessible and therefore predictable; given time deliverability is always possible.  Administrating the environment that defends this time in a coherent manner has always attracted me as our key research project.  What makes the unMo unlike all other project residencies? 


Your comment //‘chosen to go that way’// illuminates this balancing point.  Friendship does too easily become a commodity; we shift surroundings - people vanish.  Creating mandatory false fellowship is not the answer.  "Ours was a choice-by-ordeal; the cleansing shock of deprivation hit the original settlers hard.  As we lifted our eyes from our cold plates, we had only each other and our sense of community."  (See my report to Rosella : //"[[http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/|The Health of the Idea Fountain]]"//)  As things stabilised and when the whip of 'responsibility' was raised by some, this sense of community was deemed a luxury and its cultivation a self-indulgence.


I would suggest that the contagious appeal of the unMonastery project is the popular imagery of the monastery:  service, sacrifice, contemplation and the collective cultivation of ecstasy.  Under another name the package would not sell so readily.   Of course, we flirt with the trappings of a cult -- but as long as we design ourselves as a non-hierarchical, fun-loving, outward facing cult we shall probably be able to negotiate a palatable interface.//"  ((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11084#comment-11084 )) 



**(Appoint) Burnout Monitors:  Changeable roles where people are mainly concerned with peoples’ physical and mental wellbeing. This role should be part of 'Balance Strategies'.**

//"Contrary to the impression possibly conveyed by this book, unMonasterians were aware that strategic thinking goes beyond constructing the best case scenario. Despite the 'harsh' reality surrounding the prototype, each of us tried their best to adapt to the situation and deliver the projects in some form. We lacked however a commitment to continually discuss and analyse the emerging situations beyond survival modus.  Instead of bringing decisions back into the circle to allow other, more moderate voices to have an influence, emotionally driven and individualistic leadership was occasionally left to run projects, . Burn-out and detachment, as well as lack of time, prevented the //"Trusting The Process"// principle to be consistently applied. An important lesson was that this more often resulted in losing strategical thinking than losing harmony in the group. The "We" was our guarantee to function efficiently and intelligently under all circumstances."//
