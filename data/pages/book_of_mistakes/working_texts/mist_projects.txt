===== Projects ====== 

**1.0 What we’re finding on the ground is that 10+ individual projects is an enormous logistical strain, particularly within the time frame - not enough attention was paid to the invisible workload; translation, communication/advertising, (hidden) administration, managing the building, living etc.** ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/rethinking-employment-strategies-at-the-unmonastery))

//"Parachuting in with our pre-formed beliefs leaves us with a mentality of adjusting the terrain to fit the map.
Healthier for all concerned is to perform an illuminating arrival ceremony of burning one's preconceptions and application text.  If, at some point in the future, the charred remnants may be dredged forth from one’s memory, they are thereby all the more valuable.  However, it is equally legitimate to build a completely other project.  — It is carved somewhere on the unMo walls that we should “Listen always to what is emerging”.

Massive projects can get heavy.  Delivering deliverables can evoke tunnel vision.  The stubborn spectre of perfectionism can rear its head; projects artificially supported by conceptual scaffolding can get all bad mannered and unruly in the face of reality.
To counteract this the preferred project management device is the articulation of sub-objectives with which to illuminate the day to day occurrences which nourish the project environment.   In the unMo, part of this articulation is instinctive; however our grand mission can get easily obscured by pressing immediate concerns. So while the way of the world encourages independence, performance and cleverness, we unMonasterians risk a quick extinction unless we employ human skills that foster camaraderie, generosity, and deep inter-reliance.  Taking the time to articulate the need to cultivate these inner workings that support all our efforts is a vital step.  Our greater PROJECTS are to be constructed of [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_fieldwork|progettini]]."// ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/27/it-is-written/))
