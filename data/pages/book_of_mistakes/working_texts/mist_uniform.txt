===== Uniforms =====

|Unless we wanted our activities to only exist in online documentation, mostly unnoticed by our host community, unMonasterians needed to be recognisable.  During the initial Matera prototype period, we did not develop a distinctive visible "habit", but it emerged that the idea was too vital to allow it to drop. This was not only because visibility became recurrently desirable, but also because the need to develop internal ways of behaviour that an unMonasterian pledges to accommodate turned out to be essential in building the in-house community.|

//"Uniforms have always been carries of messages highlighting the collective identity and eclipsing individual subjectivity- In religion, uniforms express virtue, in armies bravery and obedience, at work, hygiene, order, status. All uniforms have the aim to provide an individual with sameness within a collective, while at the same time making her or him distinct from the members of another collective."// ((http://www.serpicanaro.com/production/multiforma-from-workshop-to-pattern))


Cannot we get Lucia to write on the anti-cult insurance here?

//"To inhabit together thus meant for the monks to share, not simply a place or a style of dress, but first of all a habitus. The monk is in this sense a man who lives in the mode of "inhabiting", according to a rule and a form of life. It is certain, nevertheless, that cenoby represents the attemp to make habit and form of lige coincide in an absolute and total habitus, in which it would not be possibile to distinguish between dress and way of life. The distance that separates the two meanings of the term habitus will never completely disappear, however, and will durably mark the definition of the monastic condition with its ambiguity."// (The Highest Poverty: Monastic Rules and Form-of-Life - By Giorgio Agamben) ((https://edgeryders.eu/making-lote3/uniforms-habit-and-belonging-workshop-proposal-at-lote-0))

//"What happened to the notion that the unMonasterians were going to have a
'habit' (monkish clothing, not drugs) ?...a strong personal signifier of
being an unMonasterian...

There was talk of hats or sashes....that would be visible and stylish
...without being a permanent fixture ..."//((ArthurD commented on unMonastery Matera's visual identity: asset or liability?  in the unMonastery [1] group: [[http://edgeryders.eu/comment/9136#comment-9136]]))


===== Filthy Habits =====
"The question recently arose – What became of the unMonasterian’s ‘habit-forming’ workshop?  The truth is standing out as instantly distinguishable from the more standard tourist remains desirable – but (in the established climate) intruding upon the 'Cult of the Individual' seems dangerous territory.  The workshop with Zoe at the LOTE#3 could only scratch the surface of desirability.  Values such as stitching your own garment within the first week were applauded as wise.

But quite independent of the design issues, without a forum to create a consensus around such a practice, any decision would have to be left to the first convention of unMonasterians.  By the time we first sat //faccia a faccia// our options were limited.  More prosaic considerations commanded our attention; what we looked like was the least of our concerns – deprived of heat, sleep, internet connection we felt distinctly and proudly unMonkish.  That would suffice.

The easiest would have been to steal Ben’s elegant long black habit.  I would have thrived in a rich, warm brown variant, Marc could have sported steel grey without fracturing his style.  Katalin could explore her options: a red, a violet, a cream?  Elf clothing an unabashed sports car green; who would wear white? or sacred saffron?  What colours could would result if we boiled down the pigments of the neighbouring //Murgia?//*

Does this belong in the Book of Errors ? – Yes, indeed.  Along with the ceremony of taking upon ourselves the habit of an unMoaner would be the inevitable mumbo jumbo.  Rituals to ease the transition from the evil habits of a civilian were meant to be my((Presumably the Scribe.- ed.)) territory; in practice a fear of appearing a cult has left us frighteningly normal.  The inevitable phases of landing and lurching are explored in //The Vow of unSomething//.((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/09/the-vow-of-unsomething/))

*Should we indeed retain our customary names?  Traditionally they were surrendered at the gate along with all worldly possessions and the hair on your head.  A simple swap might suffice; I’ve always coveted the name //Arthur//."((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/24/filthy-habits/))
