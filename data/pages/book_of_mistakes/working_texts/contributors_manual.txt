==== Manual for unMistakes contributors ====


**The Format**   
Katalin and I have come up with what we consider a streamlined and accessible format.
It offers three layers of narrative.   Your contribution can occur at all three levels, although perhaps the third offers most scope for direct interaction :

1)
The outer/surface layer appears as small insightful snippets each worthy of consideration (called for now **The Principles**.)  These are modeled after Wittgenstein’s [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philosophical_Investigations|Investigations]] at the inspired suggestion of the Hausel, and appear as short aphorisms which may or may not have echoes of the Benedictine’s //præcepta vitæ// (aka The Rule) woven in.

The Principles are not specifically written for **The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions** (BM) but are culled from various sources as snippets that function as key precepts.   Short chunks work well; if they are occasionally longer this adds desirable variation.   Some of them may later become recycled as ‘//The Protocol//’.

Each Principles or cluster of principles are grouped to correspond to the themes of the //Method Kit card set//.  The thematic link should be evident although the key descriptive word may evolve and diverge from the card text (perhaps causing it to change.)  Beneath this surface layer, We generally  place the core text itself.

2)
**The Core Text** is also largely not written for the occasion.  We are calling them **//The Evidences//**. The original source of these documents can be lifted from ancient and recent Edgeryder discussions, group emails, press releases, websites, trello text, the Davies archive etc.  The card themes should help illuminate why they are included; however, it will often be the case that short sentences of introduction that bridge the idea would help the reader grasp the context of the time frame within which this was written.  with some conjecture as to the historic occasion that sparked this discussion.  (//see examples//) 

While //The Principles// are pithy and profound, this core text can be more expansive and tangential.  Appearing as anecdotal commentary to the often cryptic and arcane allusions to the unMon practice as it appears in the Principles, the core text with its ‘evidence’ should sound scholarly rather than the way of opinion.  Written anonymously they should seek to understand and ‘almost always’ be supportive of the historical constraints and circumstances surrounding the purposed wisdom put forth in the text. ** These should appear with a reference URL as to where they and their greater context are to be found.  The general rule is that the body of the BM text is not to be written but unearthed.**  You can add to these, or put things in a footnote with the suggestion that they be elevated.  Please do not delete anything. 

3)
The third innermost level of documentation is **Interpretation & Commentary:**
It may be the case that the core text quotes supporting the highly subjective selection of ‘Principles’ appear decidedly full of shit.  This should be noted in the form of extensive footnotes that hopefully create a lively dialog.  These Footnotes seek to decipher the selected quotes and attempt in at least quasi scholarly manner to give even speculative background, dissenting opinion etc.  ( These should often also give references to secondary sources and/or be cross referenced to contradictory statements.)  Stronger dissent, divergence or disdain should be registered as such with evidence from chapter and verse numbers and/or with documentary evidence in the voice of a detective/scholar (with URL.) 

It is quite within the tradition that the character of the commentator accompanies his/her insertions.  Scholarly intros needn’t be dry, but can be diplomatically oblique: //“Thinly veiled behind this assertion lurks....//)

As of now these inserted commentaries can be anonymous so that the interpretations of what is currently a community of 15 or so scholars are all heard mulling over central and peripheral divergent ‘truths’.  **-- To introduce a footnote into the text simply open a double round brackets.  This goes immediately after the text you wish to comment without a space or line shift  - the wiki takes care of numbering.**  

Comments to comments are also highly desirable.  **In which case open a new footnote with a second set of double brackets at the same place in the text.**  Think [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talmud#Commentaries|Talmudic commentaries]] that with infinite variation respectfully dissect the contradictions inherent in one small word. 

For both ones own sake and for the flavour of the document, interpretations should be written in your mother tongue.  It would be then useful, but not necessary, if you supply some kind of approximate translation ( if not the editors will apply Google translate, and then tidy it into something that makes sense even if it is a little clunky.)  If nobody really wants to write in all the world’s languages, it would be a great pity and a pedagogical weak point -- even say 5% diversity would underline an important part of the unMon reality...

4)  **NB:  A Change** //Nothing has appeared in this department to the point that I wonder if this task frightens people. To reword this point it is possible to propose a thread of a 'thought that haunts'. At this point in the editorial process this can be 'The Way of Opinion' and need not be attached.  We can certainly find a relevant place where it lights up the horizons.// 

**Open Contributions**  In addition I would like to ask each person in the extended unMonastery family to provide up to Three Key ‘Omissions/Mistakes’.  If possible this should also be written in the third person, avoiding the posture of //“I think...”//  I can supply examples, but as of now there is no style book or format.  If you find it difficult to write in such a voice, just write.  It shouldn’t take much of an editorial device to connect first person text as a footnote; the only question and element of unTransparency in the process is the choice as to what to connect them to.  

Until we are confronted with a small pile of them, I don’t have a predetermined answer as to how these responses to the ‘name your three errori’ get incorporated into the text.  This body of text is not automatically elevated to be core text in the BM.  It stands in queue in the form of raw material waiting for nomination, this elevation can happen in any of the three pathways outlined above : either extracted in a small snippets as a precepts (1s), or in larger chunks as central documentation that is inserted to adhere to and illuminate a given principle (2s).  They can also be given the form of short or extensive, anonymous* footnotes (3s)with short feed-ins such as //“One unMonastarian posted during the build up to Bambini Day...”//.  (*Although, in fact the writer would be most often traceable on the referenced page, e.g. on the ER discussion pages.)  
 These can be placed here: [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_additional_mistakes|http://unmonastery-wiki.mirelsol.org/doku.php?id=book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_additional_mistakes&do=edit&rev=0]]

**Into this queue of raw material please feel inspired to place other interesting materials from documentary sources (with URL).( ping us and we’ll create a document folder for each contributor where they can contribute such valuable things as common source material that only they remember -- such as ER correspondence that they were privy to. )** This source material will then also be available for elevation into core text by others.  It is possible to both nominate and elevate -- but it should be such that this be accompanied by a commentary that gives context and provides some insight into why this is a ‘vital precept’ of our work life.  These comments will then be subject to the same footnote upon footnote commentary procedure.  ((It becomes most sophisticated stylistically if the voices of us all are scattered as widely as possible throughout the text; instead of for example each person writing their version of the Gospel.  But let us cross this bridge when the work is before us.  We offer what we feel will is the most attractive, user-friendly technological solution that just drops material in as extended footnotes at whatever //seems// a relevant moment.

The unTransparent part and the editorial choices arise around the question of //seems//: if no acutely relevant moment is convenient another choice /device will have to be provided.  **It is utterly within the guidelines to write tangentially; rather than directly refer to detail in a particular chapter & verse of text, a contribution can veer off on whatever flight of fancy it desires.  Think of your commentaries as beginning with phrases such as : //“On the other hand...”, “In stark contrast to this point of view...”, “Paradoxically...” etc.//**  Have fun.))
