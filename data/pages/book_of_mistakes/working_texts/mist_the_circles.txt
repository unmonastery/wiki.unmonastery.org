====== The Circles ======
   
//"They lived their life in circles,
A clustered round the warmth."//       
     
|We inherited the culture of meeting circles from the [[http://www.artofhosting.org/|Art of Hosting]]. They turned out to be invaluable to build trust, openness and connection in the house and beyond. Applying them to decision making gave us the circles of consensus and of proposals, our honest attempts to create and maintain a horizontal organisational structure.|

    
2 february: //"On our first day of gathering we introduced the morning check-in circle and an evening check-out closing circle. To regulate 'Possession of the Word' we used an available pomegranate as a 'talking piece'. Later we switched our piece of ripe fruit to an elegantly rounded, prized stone from possible volcanic sources. (Within days we became addicted to this tool; once when we fell into a spontaneous round table discussion, an impressive big green pepper was grabbed as a stand-in.) Perceptible shades of content classification have gradually evolved to accompany this ritual."// ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/adherent-prototype-traditions-of-the-unmo))    
    
"It is hard to overemphasize the role of the morning and evening check-in circles in becoming a community within a matter of days, considering that we were strangers. Basically, we share briefly how we feel. We talk with intent and listen with care." ((from the Integration Package of the unMonastery))   


One accepted approach to democratising the circle is to employ the technique of the "[[http://www.heart-source.com/council/way_of_council.html/|Way of Council]]" which was learned and refined from Native American tribes in North America. There are only four "[[http://www.heart-source.com/council/4_intentions.html/|intentions]]" which are prescribed: Listening from the heart, Speaking from the heart, Succinctness, and Spontaneity.

   

**The Daily Liturgy**       
UnMonasterian Cristiano Siri has contributed greatly to our mental well being by providing a solid fundament with several small daily ritual elements culled from his work with //[[http://www.artofhosting.org/|The Art of Hosting]].// These provide a secure window of opportunity to allow everyone a chance to personally get up-to-date with how the process may be wearing upon them.  Each morning, after both our morning practice sessions on the terrace overlooking the best view in the city and after our cross-cultural breakfast, we religiously meet in a circle of at least two orbits.  The second orbit is the predicable planning circle of what each person is currently engaged with and their plans and commitments for the coming day.  The first circle is more subjective: //"How are we feeling?"//  People may be hopeful and energetic, or sleepy and discouraged; there is room for us all.  A version of this question is repeated just before bedtime.

Together these two ritual daily meetings provide an agent for keeping each other visible.  The inevitable psychic strain of so radically altering one’s life patterns and subjecting oneself to a collective rhythm and reasoning requires compassion and listening. (( http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/ This report is clearly penned on the ascendant, time would soon confuse compassion and listening with mock infinite patience and intricate explanations...))


== 1.0 Contemplation is a mixed blessing — thinking over certain phenomena gives inescapable conclusions. ==

|The circles fell victim to the amounting pressure to be effective, to our insistence that individual nomadism cannot be sacrificed, and to a certain extent to our ideal that [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_the_work|the Work]] was before [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_the_we|the We]].|
  

//"Losing the ritualised structure of the day by day sharing of our feelings jeopardised our relations with our host community. Without the group as a natural protective filter we alienated people in our host community. We were to be different from each other, diversity was one of the leading principles of the unMonastery model, and because of the need to communicate our differences in opinion, difference always showed up as a crisis. Part of the function of the circles was to absorb and distill our difference into a meaningful interface to our various and often contradicting responsibilities.//"   
   
   
   
== 2.0 To 'trust the process' we were dependent upon the circles. ==

A key failure of the unMo was to drop the cohesive circle process in a loud crack.  Impatience and incomprehension lead us to abandon a carefully constructed construct.  The unHoly mantra of //“We are a Prototype”// allowed for impulsively scrapping viable pathways in favour of unProven 'better ideas'.  In the face of legitimate external requirements, we streamlined our daily rituals and contemplative practices.  //“The Process”// was by definition a flexible container, everything was therefore equally valid.   
  
Sacrificing a labourious process to the desire for deliverables may have freed some time, but at the cost of considerable psychic precision.  Had we collectively accepted the proffered discipline, we could have approached a desired level of articulation of our work strategies.  It has been almost rudely suggested that our ‘projects’ are merely an excuse for our presence; that their function is to attract **similarly minded people** in the local community who may have use for our skills.   In practice, inviting these similarly minded people into our circles seemed to be the most powerful gesture we could offer...
