====== Imperatives ======

|Imperatives were to be our thoughtfully shared common aspirations, forming a vision for unMonastery Matera. However, most people selected were new to Edgeryders and the unMonastery idea, and had very different reasons and goals for being there. In the race to deliver, while keeping the balance inside the house and trying to understand the emerging needs and expectations, very little time was spent on sharing and shaping our vision of our work. Most significantly, we remained unaware of many personal skills and histories that may have been helpfully applied in certain critical situation.| 


== 1.0 What is it we do when we are doing our real work?  Or as Brother Siri once put it to the group: What are the experiences of WOW that made you feel that this was what being an unMonasterian was all about? ==

If it seems ununMonasterian to aspire to virtuousness, we had come to the wrong city.  Our nearest neighbour carved into the opposite side of the same geological formation was a 15th century church dedicated to the Madonna of the Virtues.  At some point we would be forced to confront //goodness//.

"Listing the component virtues of our projects may seem distasteful.  Our ‘virtuosity’ is meant to be discretely ingrained within all our worldly activities, to articulate the desire for such attributes comes dangerously close to brashly claiming their presence.  //Even if projects aren’t meant to be humble, we their perpetrators are.//

Our way out of this is to go into our circles, to distill our desirables via a collective process that masks our personal ambition and elevates the inherent vision to a function of the group.  //What is it we do when we are doing our real work?  What are our daily objectives?//  Expressed generally as, say,  “I will do some good” we remain general and toothless.  By breaking down our objectives into component parts, we gain useful precision…   

This short list of 'i virtù di progettini'//// of can readily be extended through the actor’s homework tool of articulating one’s subtext.  If I were to  humbly suggest tentative project virtues that might help us unMonasterians align our day to day work, a brief list might look like this: "  


**My Work Project
ERunMo residency — Bembo Davies
April 28th, 2013 — 7:59pm**

"Poets work through metaphor.  My job within the unMonastery so-far has been to keep shaking the metaphorical tree to see if we can loosen fresh, relevant wisdom.  With a background in social pedagogy and as a theatre director; a large proportion of my residency will naturally go to thinking about how to stimulate our ensemble — How do the unMonasteriani best function together?

My principle concern is that the human, cultural foundation of our order will determine the success of all our subsequent work…" ((Why is this not a proof that the in-house "We" is important and you failed to do your work? Can we put this someplace?   I am worried that I am going to be unMartyr of the we.
It is you who should be martyred, YOU KNEW IT AND DID NOTHING.
But, we have been through this.))  


=== The Subtext of Good Works === 

  - **To Form Friendships** - this is the easy one.  Every society has its social fault lines, the schism between those who routinely embody subconscious values, and those that actively set the same values in question.  Along this division lie human cells of curiosity that readily open for connections with our available friendship receptors.  People seek people.  People seek like minds.  Hampered by linguistic unProficiency (even as some of us daubed in Duolingo), the cultivating of human warmth becomes the currency of our exchange, fumbling forwards with grace and humility.   

Forming friendships remain our first five objectives.  Variations on the theme may provide us subtle re-writes such as: 
     *  - **to Expand your network** or 
     * - **to Gather concerned citizens** 
     * - **to Unearth strategic allies** 
     * - **to Build emotional support among like minds.**   

The true basis action of all of these objectives is feeding potential friendships. (The list then gets more precise: )   

  - **to Stimulate Cohesion / to Cultivate the We**  – The inner workings of the enterprise needs must be solid.  To give each other enough space for all personal foibles is not necessarily best policy.  The Art of Self-Sacrifice may be a finicky creature to introduce and then tame, but without it we merely replicate the environments that have driven us to this impasse of supplicating ourselves in the first place.  Working together helps.
  - **to Promote Co-consciousness** – Above and beyond documentation our work needs definition.  Coincidently, creating the one can beget the other; however, the flaws of both pen on parchment and obscure blog comment is that the best lain words of many can be consigned to a ridiculously short shelf-life beneath an enormous mountain of virtual dust. It is proposed that all documentation be hatched in pairs. Such texts in equal parts impeded and enriched by each other have an added value of tweaking convergent vision.
  - **to Value Emotional Growth** –  This goes without saying that by investing of our humanity we seek to stimulate the occupation of new territory among ourselves and our collaborators.
  - **to Spawn** – As project managers everywhere will happily testify, the sign of a good project is when it takes over its own steering.  It is in the nature of projects that they beget projects.  One can debate the absolute wisdom, but at certain stages of project life: the more the merrier.*  Drowning in brilliant ideas is a familiar symptom of even a healthy enterprise.  Not all shall find fertile soil, and an effective short, quick filter system for registering, recycling, shelving, allotting and decapitating schemes and dreams in favour of a clear tactical progression of actionables is a vital tool to possess.   ((*It has been noted that everyone who walks through the unMo doors seems to engage us in at least two additional pursuable projects… ))  (([[http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/24/i-virtu-di-progettini/]]))
