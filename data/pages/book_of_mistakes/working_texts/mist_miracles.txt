====== Miracles ======

|Despite our growing comprehension that the circumstances for the prototype and our own limited ability to navigate them deemed some of our individual and shared aspirations highly unlikely, we have to acknowledge that sometimes things worked out. We feel UnAble to take full credit for that turn of events; miracles are //progettini// which leave a mark.|

Our miracles were prosaic.  We survived; no one died.  The potential humiliation of our 'brave experiment' was arguably avoided.  We cared enough to perform this written cross-examination of our promise and our daily performance. 

At a point of despair we gathered what seemed our last available resources and pushed through a collective effort that transcended our collective effort: via the almost invisible media of the unMonastery, the Matera community gave generously to the community of Matera.  For a few proud minutes we felt vindicated.  But the moments of poetry, the deep laughs, the humans getting together are not miracles; they are life.  (( Una Giornata a Piccianello and Piccolo Popolo di Piazza are documented  [[http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/]]))

"I, Alberto, seize the opportunity of this page being little more than a stub to propose a more optimistic vision. Miracles happened not only in the House, but spread to the city as a whole, and were recognised as such. I can think of at least four:
  - Miracle of Arduino: three new open hardware projects happened in town ([[https://edgeryders.eu/en/open-source-solar-tracker|Solar Tracker]], Sassi Hydroponic Garden monitoring system ((Does anybody have a link here? Mim√¨ Coviello was the one who involved Marc in this.)), [[https://edgeryders.eu/en/kiderwind|Kiderwind]]. Kiderwind enjoyed the additional miracle of people showing up from all over Europe (Leo and Kass from the UK, Baptiste from France) to work on the [[https://edgeryders.eu/en/harmonious-hackathon/kiderwind|LOTE4 hackathon]]. 
  - Miracle of unTransit: on the Opening ceremony, tens of GPS device-wielding Materani showed up at the unMonastery. Elf dispatched them to map all of the public transport lines (including all stops) and then proceeded to import those data onto OpenStreetMap. The data are stewarded on the City of Matera's Open Data portal [[http://dati.comune.matera.it/dataset/osm-challenges!here]]. This prompted Piersoft to obtain as open data all the timetables of public trasport.
  - Miracle of CoderDojo: started at the unMonastery as a quick prototype with 15 children, CoderDojo Matera grew and grew. In just five months, that initial prototype involved most schools in town and managed to organize [[http://www.coderdojomatera.it/?p=109|a Dojo with over 1000 children]], a world record for the CoderDojo movement. CoderDojo Matera was invited to Parliament as a result. 
  - Miracle of Talent Attraction: after the unMonastery experience, Marc decided to stay.

All unBrethren can rightfully claim credit for contributing to bringing about these miracles!"
(( Alberto, as usual your boundless enthusiasm warms the heart.  However, I counsel caution; Work is Work, that some of what we did engaged segments of the population is hardly to be considered a miracle.  It was underlined at both the initial mapping community priorities workshop and in the central text of the call for projects that our work would be divided into three categories: the //in-house, interface, and outreach//.  To come running after the fact and to cherry-pick and fast-track three //outreach// efforts to the status of miraculous is to employ the same inflationary tendencies exhibited by other ecclesiastical PR departments.  Proof of miracles has an established protocol; our competitors at least have the grace to wait the appropriate seven decades before making any such declaration.  Sadly, isolated from a more comprehensive culture of social sustainability, the legacy of Open-tech School and the Coder Dojo may just be to continue the plight of the South, forcing yet another generation of the community's brightest brains to head North or abroad as cheap labour.  In which case our humble efforts needed a stronger root in basic principles.))
