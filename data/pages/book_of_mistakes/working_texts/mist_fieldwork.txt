====== Fieldwork ======

|The economical structure of the first unMonastery required that each person arrived with a project to deliver. Each unMonasterian was responsible for finding a way to get their project done, and in many cases it meant to alter or change the entire idea, based on their experience on location. It also emerged that we were embedded in a complex political, economical and psychological situation in town, and the way we did things were even more important than what we did. To recognise when to change course and when to persevere was not always obvious. All in all, finding ways to share skills and distribute knowledge proved to be the most obvious way to contribute.|


**1.0 Outreach takes years.** ((BD: The Patience of Jove, notes MA april/may))

**An articulated dent...** 
"The mountain is massive, our efforts would always remain puny.  Persistence, endurance, applied tunnel vision are often considered vital virtues should we ‘accomplish’ anything at all.  However it is legitimate to question the very concept of accomplishment.  To leave clear directions for the pursuit of as yet unaccomplished accomplishments is often a much better strategy.  Efforts that are anchored locally are worth more than anything that can be applied by the nomadic unMonasterians.  No matter how visionary our initiatives - it is through the resonance and reverberation in our collaborators that we can measure our impact.  Stepping aside at the right moment can be more valuable than stubbornly insisting upon shaping a grand finale..."  ((The unDo))

**The Extraordinary Case of unMonastery 1.0**  
"Even the most self-declared neutral social anthropologists operate as cultural imperialists; to pronounce something as observation-worthy is to intrude upon it. To rush to conclusion is offensive; the preferred tactic is to seep oneself in the social intercourse over time and to gently reflect upon ones own perceptions.   To monitor the outer form of culture without having linguistic access to its content should not be to wallow in ones exclusion, but to visit a therapeutic health bath that immerses us in the core inner life of humanity. To spend time surrounded by a richness of after-a-while familiar faces, all involved in seeking purchase to negotiate their place in their future, is an inspiration. Even with little direct access to the debate, witnessing these forces of renewal and resistance: the passion is readily absorbable.

For an outsider the pain wasn’t immediately tactile, but the fault-lines in the city are not minor. (While t)he fertile earth of a conceptual crisis may not be everyone’s cup of tea, questions of belonging and authentic voice quickly become as familiar as they are fascinating. For a people balanced upon centuries of frustration and repressed rebellion as waves of conquest have been illogically enforced, helplessness can easily become a predigested reality. Chronic negativity is only a superficial symptom – it purports to be realism even if it may often be indicative of inherited defeat.

For those of us ensconced in castles of noble concern, besieged by seemingly militant waves of indifference, to probe and provoke the citizenry by offering the luxury of wishing out loud in orderly concentric circles, is to invite rebellion. To carry on is a sign of bravery.  In the vibrant climate a periphery of such a broad social project, the unMonastery perceives itself as essential. Not in the sense of that the MA2019 process cannot do without us, but we see in our experimental prototype an alchemic distillation that hopefully one day very soon shall surrender the secret essence of all human endeavors..."((//The Extraordinary Case of unMonastery 1.0// a report of the closing days.

** 2.0 Repulsed by our insularity some seek refuge in the fleeting pleasures of fieldwork; while others, perhaps feeling dissatisfied with the superficiality of their field presence, retreat to the confines of the manageable chores within the unMo walls.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/24/the-healing-arts/))


"//On the ground, the work that this residency would enable me to do, would be to work with local people to create a sustainable digital asset for Open Culture. We would run training courses at several venues around the city (the University, the kung Fu School, the Liceo Artistico, Mediatec, and Guerilla Office venues around the city. This would be an urban autonomous university on open culture! I've researched the venues, and with the exception of the Mediatec which we should know about soon, we have permission to run courses at all these venues. Working with the guys at Guerilla Office and some of the cafés and hotel lobbies we have found here with good wifi, we'd add to the map free spaces for urban learning.//" ((Excerpt from a Project proposal: https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/living-and-working-as-an-unmonk-wiki))


"Our projects shall and must dissolve to redefine their arc.  Grand plans despite their magnificent lines must adapt to reality, and while befriending reality is often wise, it would be desirable for our day to day project design to be modified by something more than the need to survive.  Our conscious choices are better spurred by a desire for elegance than for purely practical considerations; sketching an array of desirable '//progettini//' can be an illuminating strategy…

=== 4.0 I Progettini are the connective tissue of life in the project world: they are the conscious choices that align our availability and project our willingness to listen. ===

( excerpts from evaluation report March)
"The latest and most promising revelation is the articulation of //I Progettini// These can yet prove to be the nuance providing tool with which to appraise our true working surface.

===== i progettini =====

The grandiose project Mission Statement is meant to be an unObtainable wish – a navigational star placed so conveniently far from reality – that no matter how convincingly we have bashed our heads against the wall, it is there shining in the heavens as soon as we regain consciousness.  If off course, we can swiftly spot our orientation and adjust our direction.

When the guide post for a major project exists at such a distance as to defy nuanced perspective, we must often turn to our practical daily interactions in order to at all measure any forward motion.  However, if we can then adjust the terms of our examination with even minor degrees of magnification, progress becomes quickly breathtaking.

To facilitate our daily, more prosaic growth it is desirable to deconstruct THE UPPER CASE PROJECT into component //‘progettini’//.   Progettini are our conscious positive steps in close-up.  They are the openings opened, our daily desirables.  Focussing upon these natural by-products of a project description can inform us when we are really doing what we intend to be doing.  Identifying the refined facets of our living interface helps us evolve our true projects; we can begin to interact with reality.

Listing the component //virtues// of our projects may seem distasteful.  Our //‘virtuosity’// is meant to be discretely ingrained within all our worldly activities; to articulate the desire for such attributes comes dangerously close to brashly claiming their presence.  Even if projects aren’t meant to be humble, we their perpetrators are.

Our way out of this is to go into our circles, to distill our desirables via a collective process that masks our personal ambition and elevates the inherent vision to a function of the group.  If I were to humbly suggest tentative project virtues that might help us unMonasterians align our day to day work, a brief list might look like this:

  * **participatory** — leave behind the experience of doing the work;
  * **visceral** — incorporate the joy of physical effort at that core of the exchange;
  * **inhabit a linguistically level (or lower) playing field**;
  * **elegant** — in accomplishment and idea;
  * **demonstrative of the creation of surplus value** "  ((This short list of //i virtù di progettini// of can readily be extended through the actor’s homework tool of articulating one’s subtext.  What is it we do when we are doing our real work?  Or as Brother Siri once put it to the group: //What are the experiences of WOW that made you feel that this was what being an unMonasterian was all about?//  What are our daily objectives?  Expressed generally as, say,  //“I will do some good”// we remain general and toothless.  By breaking down our objectives into component parts, we gain useful precision… "))
