===The Code  ===   

The desire to consciously cultivating //‘We code’// seemed too dangerous and too subject to sabotage.  One voice could scupper any proposal.  Because everything in a ‘prototype’ is a proposal, long term survival of an idea wasn’t an immediate issue, everything was equally expendable.  As long as we were reasonably convinced that we were 'Living on the Edge' we could be content as laboratory rats. 

We cannot write //unRule// for quite obvious reasons; things would rapidly become //unRuly//.  For slightly less obvious reasons it is also difficult to have //Rule//.  The emotional modus of living in the unMonastery is somewhat more complex than humbly subjecting oneself to wiser ways.  For the modern human to willingly undercast themselves a hierarchy is generally considered a symptom of personality disorder.   The last 200 years of European history have declared that we are all //‘individuals’// with equal rights to determine our place on this glorious earth.  **We no longer do:  tribe, clan, social strata, our humble station or even family.**

According to some readings of the traditional monastic movement, the monastic gates took aboard political refugees and societal outcasts for refurbishing -- no questions asked ?   This seems highly unlikely.  More plausibly, the questions were few, simple, direct and uncompromising: //'Are you willing to unFlinchingly follow the ways of the brotherhood?'//  It is easy to imagine that the answer was a silent nod of an already lowered head - this accompanied by the clatter of surrendering all ones personal belongings.

As Francesco of Imaginateca asked as he wrestled with accepting his membership into the first unMonastery cull: //What kind of people can so drop their life as to enroll themselves in an undefined community of unknowns? //  Internally, we debated this ‘brave experiment’ as strategic unemployment.  Externally, what is being said is routinely blithely ignored by the core practitioners.((//"I like this text, but it needs a principle, [and I strongly believe we MUST PROPOSE A PROTOCOL. This entry is fabricating a way to cop-out, and that will not fly. It is irresponsible, future unMonasteries need some stones to get started, otherwise it just all amounts to blowing bubbles, each as fragile as the next. It is a legacy, we have to make the effort to create one from the first prototype.]"//))
