====== The Kitchen ======

|The unMonastery consists of a diverse group of very different people living in the same building provided by a host community. How they can become a family was one of the main questions from the inception of the idea.  Culturally accessible for all, eating together, and cooking for each other is an obvious start. Inviting our slowly growing number of friends and acquaintances for dinner was the least risky manner to prove ourselves as trustworthy: even if the food was not the quality of average Italian cuisine, it was at least unlikely that as hosts, we trespass social norms we were unaware of. |   
 

== 1.0 It has been stated that feeding the unMonks shall be the key to the survival of our initiative. ==

"//unMoaners sublimate.  Our most significant strategy is the heaping upon one another of generous portions of incredibly sumptuous foods.  Twice a day seemingly haphazard pairings of the house’s inhabitants conspire to inspire.  Turning the glories garnered from local markets into our agency of appreciation and bombarding one another with the best we have on offer, we can get carried away.//"  ((Sometimes it goes wrong.  Bland pasta tastes like bland pasta — the lack of love resounds around the unMon eating hall.  Harmony does not reign...   Sumptuousness in its absence can expand beyond the merely insipid — it easily becomes an affront to virtue.  Incompetence, or an injudicious spice quota, reflects not a bad day in the kitchen but disdain for the collective.  To serve a flat sauce or even an over-ornate show-off of a salad is to kick the captive audience where it hurts.  Vows have been broken for less…    http://bembodavies.com/2014/07/28/the-currency-of-grace/))



** "It is written somewhere in the Lore of the unMonastery that the Kitchen shall be the Queen of the House.**  This was most clearly voiced in preparatory discussions between Rita Pacheco and Antonio Elettrico.  In the face of subjectively perceived poverty, solace would inevitably be sought in the creative act of creating and sharing meals.  

"//The sensuous quality of fresh local produce has brought us great satisfaction.  For one habitually living further up the food chain, and therefore being routinely fed by agro-bizniz, it has been a liberation to share my greens with an occasional snail.  That some of the late winter local vegetables don’t immediately awaken the warmth of familiarity, can also challenge the taste buds and digestive juices; sometimes our cooking committees can be accused of substituting quantity for quality.  However, early on in the group process we elected to outlaw the natural human psychic ventilation system of the 'complaint' [ Note: the above statements are pure fact; the author is not indulging in hidden complaining.]//"

At the same time, others of our crew have been subject to the most cruel //‘Tyranny of the Oppressed Minority’//; accepting imposed levels of vegetarianism that go unnoticed by the adherents, but that push the digestive tracts of others into virulent rebellion.  Surrounded by old-fashioned shops offering short-journeyed meat, and magnificent fish counters laden with enticing often unknown species, this deprivation easily amounts to culinary torture.

"//The delicate balance of the **Healing Power of Mealtimes** is dependent upon several factors.  We feel that we have secured a satisfactory source of quality raw materials.  We  have a healthy competition to create works of art in a room that was long unheated, and upon an uncooperative brand-new obsolete technology from the first generation of the induction stove.  That we are still under equipped with basic tools like soup spoons and chopping knives that chop and that would make life a touch more civilised, should soon be rectified.  What is harder to see the solution for, is the projected life of the kitchen as a functioning unit for more than two cooks and more than ten eaters.  The need to model this our primary source of harmony upon large scale cooperative kitchen operations was spoken about on the ER platform prior to the LOTE and, as the meeting that commissioned this emotional health report clearly indicated, it remains the one place of recurrent frustration — the unMonastarians are willing to use their outreach project budgets to rectify matters, but feel that hidden criteria for what is an acceptable solution that pit beauty against functionality are being employed.  That this has dragged out into our second month of residency and until our second wave of unMonasterians has cost us much valuable time and psychic resources."// ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/)) ((Arguably, this paragraph is a prime example of "complaining", practiced enthusiastically by early unMonasterians, before the establishment of the rule of No Complaining.))

My couchsurfer regularly visited the monasteries of Vietnam and perked up when she heard of my upcoming plans.  She reported one management strategy direct from the abbott's mouth: "Chose the most pleasant, easy-going monk to administrate the kitchen, it keeps the whole compound happy and harmonious."

//The kitchen also became a barometer of the atmosphere in the house: when we functioned well as a community, there was a lightness and grace at mealtimes. When the stress increased and a lost sense of purpose appeared, it was accompanied by bickering over portions, quality, and infrastructure management (read dishwashing).  (( This is sloppy journalism, too easy and not nuanced.  My line about berating each other through culinary excellence is closer to the truth and includes all the greys of being adult and civilised while weeping inside. To paint us as petty souls is of no interest. Yes, you took too much salad, to mention this is not bickering, but correct politics of collective life.  Whether it is latent aristocratic tendencies or myopia is immaterial. )) In times of crises, people often opted to eat out, unheard of in the volumes preceding (?) the actual unMonastery in Matera.//  

   
==== Cooking Good ====
Among the virtues professed by the unMonastery kitchen was responsible eating.  We ate morally good food that arrived upon our bowls through thoroughly approved pathways.  Considered to be the holiest of the holy were ‘Gifts and Barter’.  Otherwise we entered the Market.  Rigourous bookkeeping registered every expenditure as to the source and journey it had taken.  Biological products from local sources whose name we kept forgetting were more virtuous than fairtrade; fairtrade more defensible than cheese from a far off corner of the country.  In the unMonasterian gastronomic heavens unSeasonable vegetables were frowned upon.  And frown we could.     


**Money Talks**   
    
Compromises occurred and reoccurred: we strove to maintain an inorganic boundary of 6€ a day per head which would also accommodate a generous stream of guests.  To get all this into place //presto// required negotiation, negotiation requires language.  The task of filling fridge and larder was embraced by the one inhabitant that had no pressing hidden agenda to exercise himself in the marketplace.  Accompanied at times by a loyal two-armed sidekick, unBrother Siri sought to solve all problems of a logistical, supply chain and economic nature.  But, in allowing him to dodge tourist prices on our behalf, we surrendered a huge chunk of our natural daily interface.  Even when mutely slinking through the aisles at Supermimo’s, we would have soon found ourselves engaged in free-range organic conversation.  Instead of cultivating our interface, our search for virtue helped prolong an unsustainable silence.
