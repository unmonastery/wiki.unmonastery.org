====== Interface ======


== 1.0 The unMo speaks of treasuring its interface.  The unMo speaks of Listening to its Walls. ==

"(The cave) walls are not just walls but fault lines of least resistance; carefully carved vaults that have become pockmarked through centuries of seeping condensation.  Any signs of willed human interaction do not indicate impatience nor aesthetic blindness, they are rather intrusions spurred by the need to survive."


**2.0 It is written somewhere in the literature that itinerant unMonasterians are to create their existence human contact by human contact.** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/27/it-is-written/))


"//This calls for a slight change of mentality:// ((This is //the// understatement of the Prototype era. -KH)) //in order to be open we need to create the infrastructure for openness.//" ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/rethinking-employment-strategies-at-the-unmonastery))

|The unMonastery was always to be embedded and actively engaged in the community it serves. The question of how this engagement would happen was not specifically addressed in the preparatory materials for the prototype. There was the assumption that like-minded people would adopt us and our projects; the liason group that brought the unMonastery to town would hook us up. |


"//UnMonasterians are dependent upon nuanced, intricate communication with their host communities.  Some things can go through the filter of translators, some cracks can be circumvented via significant ritual.  Goodwill goes a long way.   However, to augment our capacity to have an effective presence in the field, every technique to build our linguistic proficiency should be incorporated into our daily practice.//"  ((An unDeveloped sketch under the title [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I_1C-lLkYAswqDY_b0CkR8lsVX36crV98IJLsW_41Tc/edit|Psycholinguistics]] was proposed, but lacked the pedagogical resources in the house to insist that it be made a priority over preparing a bilingual website; see communications (?) )) ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))

**3.0 "Being osmotic: immerse yourself in local friend circles, culture, language, lifestyle. Spread out what you absorb to the benefit of the circles you belong. Get out of your comfort zone, absorbing will be maximized and magic."** ((The Siri Papers,  https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyIje9lqc1oFF7viViN6Tpls3p0J50GmTbuD47_m-XY/edit))

... "the critique that rained upon the unMonastery prototype Matera from its inception was:  that perched down there in idyllic Tourist Zone A, we were far removed from the people:// If the unMonastery was to improve life for the town’s citizens this meant that we’d have to engage them where they lived."//  ((to go later ?: In Matera, it turned out that the association which decided to bring us to the city were themselves considered outsiders by much of the town. Local associations who were meant to be our great allies considered us superfluous: why the money cannot go to them instead? Furthermore, most unMonasterians did not speak Italian, so developing an interface on our own was slow if not impossible. As a result, we overstretched our most committed allies and alienated key persons by relying upon them too much to sort out everyday problems and facilitate individual project needs. The relationships we were building in the house, based on caring and love and trust, could hardly manifest itself in such strained situation with the outside world. By the time we made adjustments to address our interface problem (bringing Italian speaking unMonasterians on, developing "progettini" which were visible and comprehensible despite of our linguistic incompetence, and organising a neighborhood event, the atmosphere in the unMonastery shifted, and instead of cultivating the "we", we were rushed to deliver tangible results. By the time we figured out the "how" of developing an interface, we lost our inner core, the "what" we wanted to be seen as.))    


"//The bi-weekly cycle of Open Parties fired the daily life of the unMos.  The 26 annual markings of the meeting places between what at the start must have appeared a minor, incoherent sect, quickly grew to become a vital interface with the host community.  Designing ritual celebrating for each Season, for the Elements, for traditional local and global traditions, and including children and families these most human of gatherings both enhanced and informed the strategies of community take-over and the de-unMonastration process.//" ((The Art of the Party)) ((Several months later this proposal was spoken about in past tense under the clearly bitter title:  **Empty Gestures ?**  

"(One) contribution to the house structure was to propose a cycle of bi-weekly parties with which to encapsulate our interface with our surrounds in something culturally coherent and hopefully contagious.  These started out well.  Party #1 at day 12 was a warm and heartfelt affair.  Party #2 was more decentralised as unMoaners dispersed throughout Basilicata in search of the ‘true’ carnival.  Our third party (discussed elsewhere) was a vibrant triumph -- not only did it fulfill our needs to exercise our potential interface, it illuminated the weaknesses in our operation.  In the aftermath of this event things took a dive...  
**  Virtual Parties**   

 Instead of concentrating on our strengths as a cultural facility, a perceived superficial weakness of low international visibility was given disproportionate attention.  The bi-weekly party slot was usurped in favour of a weekly ‘community review’ to be sweetened by an Open Dinner that people could invite themselves to via our sadly unReliable webpage.  This combo was eagerly embraced by a segment of our in-house population; the Community Review bit to be held as simulcast testimonials over the work we were doing (or at least polished up as YouTube fodder.)  The first round were clever, polite, and excessively boring.  They were bad theatre.  Attending the first evening I was provoked by the paucity of emotional meat being offered a largely non-comprehending audience of 5-6 people.  The performer in me jumped into this vacuum and improvised an impromptu work demonstration that, insensitively labelled by an uncomprehending co-worker, rapidly became a cause celebré. (set in internal link)

  Thankfully, the next party in the two-week cycle was also a reported triumph - //Open Tech School’s// birthday party for the Arduino Board attracted an active, inquisitive crowd in such proportions that calling it a crowd is not mere rhetoric.  However, the next week’s 'Community Review / Open Dinner' soon revealed the bankruptcy of its guiding principle -- minted for our international supporters the community review had nothing to offer the local community.  The third party in this series (featured live feed from Norway) and may have appeared on three or four laptops around the globe, but it hosted a grand total of zero 'analog guests'...))

**"Her fellow unMonasterians were aghast at Katalin Hausel, when already in the second week of February she was declaring that our real work should be outside the unMo walls: that we should burden our endeavors to establish a satellite storefront location somewhere where the people live?  Three months later, we’ve done just that…..."**

   


"We struggled a bit with a name.  The generic ‘Mapping the Commons’ proposed for the grand scheme of things was not at all translatable even into English.  Everything else we came up with reflected nefarious colonial ambition.  Finally we fell upon a description of the simple fact:  **“Una Giornata nel Piccianello"** ( A Day in Piccianello ); this promised no more than a solitary, almost coincidental crossing of paths...     


//It seems a combination of something low-key and organic made the evening work without PR flags and amplifiers.  The unMo lights were reduced to candles; the pomp was left to the performers. It was a simple but significant celebration of deep culture between young people who believed in the naked word, and a statistically moderately older people absorbing this belief.  As Nalia, one of the our crowd of loyal unMo friendly pensioners, whispered to Lucia : “Questo è il vicinato.” (This is neighbourhood.)//"((The events at our unMon2 satellite including our children's workshop in The Art of Occupying Public Spaces (//Il Piccolo Popolo di Piazza//) are illuminated under the title : "A Good Move" //**"Una Giornata a Piccianello"**//  [[http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/]]))


"//My latest is to kidnap the 3rd Bambini Day which has been transposed to outside the school in Piccianello.  Now it is called something like "Che è nome di la nostra piazza?" (Il Piccolo Popolo di Piazza), it will be a children's workshop in squatting and occupying their own world.  By coincidence we have 13 kgs of grey clay leftover from last time with which to build small people and animals who can live among the silly communal sculptural elements that noone plays upon.  In the middle, with the same clay, we can turn the white pole into the expressive totem that I have wanted for so long...//"
