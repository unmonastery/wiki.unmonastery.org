====== 200 Year Strategy ======


"//You say 3 years, I suggest 200 years, as decades pass we may even cease to call it unMonastery altogether, or maybe we'll find it carved in stone across Europe. So allow me to throw a question back for furthering discussion, that might provide a route towards the issue of decentralised ritual, tradition and time restrictions; How do you co-design for a 200 year project in 4 months?//

|The 200 year plan allowed us to extend into the past and the future, and learn from our yet unmade mistakes and triumphs. It also helped us to ride through the rough time periods of tangible result production during the prototype.|

== 1.0 Living in a labyrinth it is tempting to set up camp in the relative comfort of a known cul-de-sac.  The way forward invites even more heart-wrenchingly false steps.  Inertia is safety. ==

== 2.0 A deeper question went unAnswered:  If we are not-pious, not-self-sacrificing, non-believers, how can we work very real miracles? ==

== 3.0 Building upon reality, and at the same time refusing to acknowledge the limitations it places upon us; the unMonasterians have evolved the rhetorical tool of the 200 year’s timeline on which to stretch our decisions about unMo life.  Being from the beginning a ‘prototype’ all potential choices are viewed as proposals; personal initiatives are considered invitations. ==



**"unUnmo:**  

It is during this pivotal exercise that the conception of **"The Book of Greater and Lesser Failures"** first occurred:   
//"A key tool in the spread of the unMo idea was a capacity to admit our fears and vulnerabilities."//    

  
The (200 year) text also envisioned an elegant exit strategy:  
//At some point ER and unMo vanished as a distinguishable organ, dropping its identity as people became absorbed by a deeper unity of purpose.  Years of interdependence while constantly promoting fresh ideas and renewal, lead to the dissolution of formal structures at organic points.   And while the functions of a collective work station for itinerant freelancers certainly became the norm and unMo-like houses still littered the countryside, so much a part of the fabric of life had they become that (it was) other alliances (that) defined the networks."//



==== Mining the unMonastery Metaphor ( open pit variant) ====
From the moment of the first public voicing of the //un-Word// at the LOTE#1 gathering, exploring the imagery of the unMonastery has been a source of joy and inspiration. What started as perhaps a rather flimsy premise has been consistently strengthened by the power lying latent in the history of monastic practice. At LOTE#2 (Living on the Edge gathering in Brussels, November 2012) a sub-group spent three days hacking //“The Lore of the unMo”.// Extracting direction from our collective associative matrix, we shuffled together a collective document that generated much seductive mirth.
 
Much later, a brief conference call comment sent Alberto Cottica off on **a pivotal exploration into the credo of the Benedictines**.((He reported from an enriching day immersed in the literature under the title **unHagiography: what modern-day social innovators can learn from the life and times of St. Benedict**.  It began: 
"At yesterday's call, @Bembo Davies  tried to make parallels between the protagonists of early monasticism and individual modern-day unMonasterians ("are you St. Francis?" "Huh…"). This prompted me to look into that particular piece of history in search for good stories and inspiration – therefore proving that you don't need to be religious to be inspired by the lives of the saints!

I eschewed Francis (too charismatic for comfort) and zeroed in on St. Benedict, regarded by many as the founder of Western Monasticism. And sure enough, Benedict's life and times provide plenty of good advice to anybody wishing to start or join an unMonastery. Even a cursory glance will tell you that: 

**1. Benedict was evidence-oriented.** He did experiments and trusted their results. Far from being entrenched in his belief, he appears to be worlds away from a bureaucratic style of management: his leadership style is nothing if not adaptive... 

**2. Benedict valued and prioritized action over idle disputes. //Ora et labora...//**

**3. Benedict protocolized...**(and 'may have been the Supreme Ninja Mage Lord Protocol Hacker of all time').

**4. Benedict decentralized.** Consistently with the protocol nature of the Rule (and, one suspects, with his own mindset as a protocol hacker), Benedict never actually founded an order. Benedictines are not an order in a strict sense; each monastery is a sovereign institution, with no hierarchy among them. The Rule acts as a communication protocol across monasteries...

**5. Benedict avoided sterile conflict – and so went viral."**  http://edgeryders.eu/comment/6022#comment-6022 ))

Inevitably we brought difficulties upon ourselves. In the run-up to the unMo launch, the Edgeryder community performed a tactical maneuver presumably designed to spur local impetus and descended upon our future site in Matera for our third international gathering (LOTE#3) . The orthodox cringed: //“What will become of our Cult of Firsts if the unAnointed hordes get there before us?”// Nevertheless, to thoroughly challenge fate, we suggested a gathering for the second day of LOTE that sought to illuminate our future history…

**Other explorations took a more dangerous form:**
"//To continue the valuable work of metaphor mining at LOTE#3, we chose to step into the future.   In a tactical attempt to lift our visions beyond the next mealtime, we went all historical. Under the banner of something appropriately enigmatic (("Future Thought: the unMonastery's 200 years trajectory --  An attempt to imagine the unMonastery's growth, decade by decade, construct a narrative that might point the way for the project – identifying future pitfalls in a geopolitical context.")), three groups formed to look back upon the various époques that have so influenced our unMovement during the last 200 years…   
* one group examined the **unMo Age of Expansion** and the **Influence of the Matera School** with an emphasis upon the first hundred years.   
* group two examined the **Times of the Great Schism and the unMo Wars** through the fitful fifty years of unPleasantness.   
* a third group sought to pinpoint where and how some 200 years ago the **Foundation of the unMo idea** formed a Watershed moment in the history of interhuman/interspecies cooperation. The debate was, as usual, vigorous.//

"(Volumes 1 + 2 of the unMonasterian History were inadvertently destroyed during recent renovations.  The text for group three is preserved in http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/.  An attempt to reconstruct the central threads of Group Three was performed //"as the decisive moments that enabled the unMo to negotiate a viable future through an epoch of chaos".//  Although it starts promisingly, this text has been dismissed by some as 'arrogant, stupid and big-headed utopian blather at its most naive'.  However this document also marks the birth of the concept of //**Il Libro degli Errori**// (not to be confused with the book on children's writing by Italian teacher Gianni Rodari.) ((Note: add an intro sentence here.)) "Although a minority of historians claim to have unearthed evidence among archaic web logs that reveal that the legendary early delegates, to say, the Matera Meeting of 2013, were an unPrecedented bunch of tossers, the accepted wisdom is to praise them for their foresight.  The group of Great Schism never submitted its literature. They did however send a few representatives to the unMo…  ((Deprivation and the Deprived - The Tyranny of the unRuly)) ((http://bembodavies.com/page/2/))


"Key choices to avoid the divisive extremes of visionary projection, and to hold developments to the current realities generated a robust, flexible practice.  The early unMo communities became expert at the culture of change and in harnessing the collective wisdoms of groups with an uncanny capacity absorb positive organic small scale inventions that recycled much energy into their community service.

Their work was clearly value based – not solely determined by the tasks at hand, but through an articulate shared vision that remained flexible and synchronised even when working in a decentralised, work distributed pattern.  

So skilled at transforming conflict to creative friction did we become that major organisations such as the //International Union of Black Sheep// and the //Disgruntled Young Peoples’ Alliance// ( formerly //unEmployed Youth of the Earth//) quickly found their way to the unMo.  The total package lifestyle solution that supplied a meaningful life of dedicated service and camaraderie, rapidly became so essential to many people’s existence that the unMo practice became the cultural norm.  Once the movement reached this critical mass, it exhibited such acute flexibility as to virtually unUnmonasterise itself, providing a wide dispersement of wisdom without any signs of confining ideological dogma."((
