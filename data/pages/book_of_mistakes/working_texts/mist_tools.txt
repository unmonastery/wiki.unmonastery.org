====== Tools ======


"//One valuable tool developed by the early unMonks has been the dramatic use of inflated language.  We often employ unNormal degrees of politeness and concern. When one of our number was inadvertently forced into exile for a period of days, the welcoming committee who inundated the bus station to welcome him back into the fold was quickly dubbed the// //“rescue mission”//."((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))

|The organisational, recording and psychological tools desirable to run an unMonastery were a question explored at LOTE3 several months before the prototype was established. Different expectations - to be open source, to be visible in the city and for the international community of Edgeryders, to create and nurture the community within the house - pulled us in different directions.  We needed a comprehensible, easy-to-use website in Italian, a strong Facebook presence and solid off-line communication to establish ourselves as a presence in the city; we wanted to use open-source, cutting edge technology to communicate with our international community; and it was crucial to develop and preserve an atmosphere of care, loving, openness and responsibility in the house to be able to mark ourselves as something other than 'intrusive tourists with an agenda'. The balance was not always found: we got a fully open source, highly sophisticated website two months into the prototype; after that it was perpetually out of date, especially the information in Italian.  We lacked the energy to regularly post on the Edgeryders' platform to keep that wider community informed about our progress; but most importantly, although we quickly implemented traditions that made us into a community within weeks, we could not preserve them under the mounting pressure that shifted the focus on delivering tangible results. Efficient project management seemed to be incompatible with our fledging understanding of our own culture, and we let our most important traditions go.|

2 february: //"On our first day of gathering we introduced the morning check-in circle and an evening check-out closing circle. To regulate 'Possession of the Word' we used an available pomegranate as a 'talking piece'. Later we switched our piece of ripe fruit to an elegantly rounded, prized stone from possible volcanic sources. (Within days we became addicted to this tool; once when we fell into a spontaneous round table discussion, an impressive big green pepper was grabbed as a stand-in.) Perceptible shades of content classification have gradually evolved to accompany this ritual."// ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/adherent-prototype-traditions-of-the-unmo))

"//For the most part we’ve been using Trello to organise the day-to-day running of unMonastery, our organisation is open [7], so all our tasks, discussion and planning are in public view, if you’d like to get an insight into what we’re doing at any time please feel free to view this activity.//" (elf Pavlik -first ER post from the unMonastery)

"//Professional theatre artists possess certain fundamental human tools.  We know about elemental warm ups, building circles of safety; about the minimalist increments of honesty with which one constructs fresh truths.  Conflict is to be orchestrated; metaphors are our modus operendi.  Above all, we are concerned with managing the delicate transition so that both player and witness, make a breathless leap together.//" (BD, this needs a reference, got it from your email)

"//In the projects I work on, my daily project management suite is made up of the following: SmartSheet, Twitter, Pens and Notebooks, Remember the Milk, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Trello, EdgeRyders.eu, Popplet, Gephi, Microsoft Excel, Evernote, Dropbox, Gmail Tasklist, iffft, Google Groups, a whiteboard, post-its.//" (Ben Vickers)

"At the Edgeryder LOTE#3 session on 'Tools for the unMonastery' facilitated by Victor Vorski, we broke off into several small groups.  As is often the case the composition of the groups led them in different directions.   The militant geek group reported first with their list of essential items with which to build a viable community; their key tools were a series of software applications with intriguing names such as //Milkmaid// and //Catch that Tiger//.  The list of the next group reflected other concerns; the one key item was //human warmth//."



== 1.0 It had to start with becoming a group. ==

"//For each of us, becoming part of the group was essential, a natural human need to belong, to feel safe and competent to do the work we all pledged to do. And it had to start with becoming a group. The pleasantness of our days, the restfulness of the nights, and our self-esteem were hinged on our ability to fit in.This commitment to each other is what created the unMonastery in Matera in my opinion. And the group is a useful tool for overcoming problems - it has the ability to form a padding around each of our peculiarities and shortcomings. Some people jump into projects and rush forward, and they create a momentum for others who need more time to ease into action. Some people make connections with people quicker, and deeper, than others, even despite of language barriers, and so draw a social circle around all unMonasterians, which allows the less smooth unMonks to be understood instead of being rejected by the local community - we vouchsafe for each other.//" ((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11651#comment-11651))
  

"It could hardly be a techno fix whiz miracle; the unMon needed a bilingual website up and running from Day Minus Forty-five.  To not have a central site-specific meeting place was as absurdly illiterate as to presume to run a monastery without rules.

In the open source environment to which we belong are several do-it-yourselves kits that should have served 85% of our purposes.  However, many of our people were hackers who prided ourselves in our coding finesse.  The corner of the webside alloted us by the mother.org would never work - it could at best support a percentage of internal communication and serve as a rah rah station for our admirers.  The unMonastery Prototipa Matera would build one from scratch."((  link ?))
