===== No Complaining Policy =====


**2.8 The recollection is faulty. Having gone to the extreme of invoking an 'unComplaining Policy', it seems logical that even in those most playful early days the unMonasterians deemed it a necessary reaction to a creeping toxic atmosphere.  Was it an admonition to embrace stoicism, or self-censorship to quell one or another of the assembly from polluting the fun?** ((It was a mistake. I completely forgot that even in communist Hungary, there was an institution called "Bureau of Complaints" for each firm and organisation. Instead of "No Complaining" we should have had a policy of "Complaining is strictly limited to the hours of 4-6 pm each Thursday in the cave adjacent to the kitchen, with the unAbbott present". KH))

"Our greatest impatience we reserved for our ‘parents’ – our sponsoring bodies here on earth whose efforts through the months hadn’t quite got us the roof over our heads that ‘everybody else had’.  When the invoice showed up that showed that the mattresses upon which we were to lay our weary heads likely came late because they weren’t ordered until the day before our scheduled arrival, we may have been a tad ungrateful.  National stereotypes were no doubt muttered.  Arms were reported waved.
In the face of unilateral paternalism, we temper tantrumed.  When the kids wouldn’t tidy up for guests, or if we asked too many pointed questions, we were sent to our rooms and ignored.  When these rooms proved mouldy and unheated, we hammered on the wall in a cloud of name calling.   Refusing to eat our dinner, not getting out of bed and inappropriate language were all indulged in.
Behaving like naughty children, we became treated as naughty children.   In a fit of adolescent hubris we declared independence, and psychically moved beyond the range of parental influence at first opportunity.  When it proved the case that we sorely missed human contact, we felt heartlessly deserted by our mothers.  A case may be made that some of us perhaps exhibited an unVersion of attention deficit disorder."


|The vision was 2 years old, far-reaching and complex by the time the materialisation of the unMonastery idea became realised - some aspects of it were inherently contradictory.((Is this not blatant complaining? -BD )) The prototype was accompanied by several serious compromises. It was no wonder that we started - by complaining. Our stakeholders followed. We invoked our first and still most pervasive policy: "No Complaining". |


**TOOLosophy**  
In fact the unComplaining rule fell into our collective laps via the miracle of the Edgeryders' open dicussion pages, an anonymous unMonk calling herself TOOLosophy announced that he would be throwing wisdom our way:

//14 February  
"There's to be acceptance to people that come from very different places (using this metaphorically as well as literally). There is to be willingness to hear "reasonable criticisms or observations" and to learn from the example of others...In a world that builds barriers, puts up walls, keeps the other out, and is looking for certainty, we turn to the Rule and find a man who
insists on balance, mutual respect, reciprocity, openess. [Benedict]...who refused to live with a closed mind."//
--  Esther de Waal, A Life-giving Way

//"Complaining is the acid that shrivels our own soul and the soul of the community around us as well"// 
--  Sr. Joan Chittister, The Rule of Benedict((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/monastic-wisdom))


== 2.9 The corollary of no complaining is no blaming. ==

In our hyper-humility we recognise that our fellow humans are human. They will take action, they will refrain from taking action. The forces are many and largely invisible. The joy of feeding the collective effort can mysteriously evaporate from time to time.  If civilized conversation was indeed indulged in, it was largely saved for cursing the Gods.  When we finally opened our mouths it was to invoke a ‘No Complaining’ clause that forced us to shut them again.  The temptation to exist in a cloud of flawed or over-verbose English was irresistible.
