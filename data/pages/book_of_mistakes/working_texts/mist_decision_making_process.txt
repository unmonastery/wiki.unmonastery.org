====== Decision Making Process ======

=== 1.0 Lacking a mechanism to take hard decisions was a major weak point in the establishment of the unMon Protoype. Devising such a mechanism remains our most unresolved goal. ===
   
"Questions remain to be thrashed out:  //"Can I bring my dog, spouse, children, parents?  Can unMonasterians not partake in the glorious public dining practices of the town?  Is dancing with the locals verboten?"//   We can always import solutions from similar initiatives elsewhere, or being open, generous, and anxious not to turn anyone away from the inn, we can evolve our own mistakes…  Not having any form of collective self-government, my personal opinions on these matters are irrelevant.  However, hard decisions are pending… Going in polite and democratic may prove too polite and too democratic."((BD early pre LOTE#3 letter fragment))

|The prototype opened without pre-conceived rules. We were there to start building it from the ground. Quickly consensus emerged as the most open and inclusive decision-making process: at that point, we were 6 in the house, with no visible deadlines just yet. After 6 weeks, reality hit: the projects that were our offered deliverables to the city had to get off the ground and yield tangible results, and there were merely 10 weeks left. Consensus was thrown out, fast planning meetings replaced circles, even //agile project management// was given a try. Important questions were raised: what is the place of horizontal organisational structure, of leadership, of caring about people, of the "we", within the unMonastery concept.|




"**1.0 The proposal and consensus circles are our decision making tools which reflect the wisdom we discovered in the check-in circles.**" ((from the unMonastery Integration Package))

6 february: "//As the need for decisions descended upon us, we performed a dissection of the decision process itself. During the day, proposals for collective agreement arrive on their own field on our process board wall to face that evening's 'consensus circle' decision making apparatus (usually at least one proposal exposed to the consensus circle make us laugh a lot). Items can languish in the 'not yet discussed' field before being promoted to agreed actionables.//"    
6 february: "//Proposals that don't necessitate a decision became labelled as invitations. The unadage that we 'Trust the Process' provoked many a nod of agreement.    
6 february: The morning planning session that organically emerged from the previous morning circles becomes our ipso facto modus operandi. The desire to get 'to work' provides a disciplinary pressure to keep this gathering streamlined and effective.//" ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/adherent-prototype-traditions-of-the-unmo))

=== 1.0 Having been reared on the cult of self-determination, we could be very determined indeed. ====


The exceptionally level playing field of crowd-sourced opinion can numerically wrench leverage out of the hands of those closest to the repercussions. The path of least resistance is notoriously flexible; born democrats just don't do self-sacrifice. Both administrative and esthetic matters could be hammered out, but little was nailed fast. Having been reared on the cult of self-determination, we could be very determined indeed.((A scribe's notebook - date unclear.))(("We all readily read into the word ‘unMonastery’ a world of ordered human interaction; the imagery spoke of a virtuous life of rigour, obedience, self-sacrifice and service.  However, to tread such virtues down over the heads of one another would be impolite and unDemocratic.  Raised in a culture of laissez-faire:  //“We knew better.”// However, the psychic pull towards granting an individual their personal leeway negated the very promise contained in the unMo imagery.  Instead of solemn vows of subjugation to a collective order, we became **understanding, generous and unFortunately //self//-indulgent.**  We were squatting a monastery; we hadn’t build it from the ground up. [This last comment is open to conjecture.  Does the scribe imply that the unMoaners were tourists in their own enlightenment? That had they accepted the ‘process’ of the “cold water weeks” (ref)  instead of entering the complain/blame syndrome and seeking to reform the behavioral patterns of their parent.org, much was to be learned?]))

   
“Proposals could be aired in the periphery, but no one could possibly take them as binding in a democracy.  As Jeff Andreoni once disrobed democracy the concept is seeped in a tradition where a steering organ of the elite dictate the order for the masses.  This clearly wasn’t in our repertoire; rules from above would need to apparently start from scratch and retain their flexibility.  The legacy of linguistic imperialism and conflicting standards of attention to detail provided the other legs of our wobbly construction.”  (( note snippet May))
  

An [[http://mappingthecommons.org/unArcheology/|unArcheology]] fragment reveals an early awareness of the vital nature of such a decision making mechanism.  Long before we opened our doors a perhaps delightfully naive projected vision was created during the LOTE#3 200 Year Workshop:
"//The total package lifestyle solution that supplied a meaningful life of dedicated service and camaraderie, rapidly became so essential to many people’s existence that the unMo practice became the cultural norm. Once the movement reached this critical mass, it exhibited such acute flexibility as to virtually unUnmonasterise itself, providing a wide dispersement of wisdom without any signs of confining ideological dogma. Perhaps the key development upon which the movements survival was predicated was the broad endorsement of invisible structures.  So culturally implicit in their collective decision making process did this become, that the unRule became dictated by the daily tasks and seasonal rhythms rather than any planning organ.  This new freedom quickly permeated the unMo vision of service saving considerable regulation and meeting time.//" ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))

The emotional loss of shifting weight from process to decision making also cost us dearly: "This ill-fated meeting that so twisted the values of community interface also marked the first appearance of a laptop in an unMonastery 'planning circle'.  Later they would become ubiquitous, streamlining the scramble to meet the demand for documentation under the slight-of-hand maneuver that decreed that an articulated progress report is somehow a full-fledged deliverable.  Humanity wept."
