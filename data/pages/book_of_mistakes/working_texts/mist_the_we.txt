====== the WE ======


    
**1.0 The one mandatory qualification for a life as unMonk/ unNun is that we are humans. Humans forget; denial is our speciality.  One task of the unMonastery is to become a library of experience: to remind one another.  Removed from the coddling of modern convenience, we shall live a life that confronts our civilizedness.  It is our capacity to surmount this confrontation that is the true fruit of our labours. ** ((Some of the inbuilt contradictions of unMonastery Matera - the confusion about the primary goal of the unMonastery experiment, the role of the challenges and individual responsibilities for solving them, in the form of personal projects, the scale of the problems to be solved and the available timeframe - actively contributed to the helplessness with which we witnessed rather than controlled our functioning as a group. Smaller, tighter alliances were formed and remained strong; but maintaining a culture of supportive, open, gentle and caring community even within the house proved to be just as elusive as it is outside of the unMonastery doors.))


|Part of the unMonastery ethos is a culture of [[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wyIje9lqc1oFF7viViN6Tpls3p0J50GmTbuD47_m-XY/edit|family love]] within the group  ((This principle has never been ratified by any unMonasterian group circle. Some individuals may have believed it; we may have lived it, but the act of articulating it was left to a good brother to write on a wall hanging in the build up to the Opening Party.)).  How to create it, how to nurture it, and how to extend it beyond our circle were to be resolved during the run of the prototype. External difficulties demonstrated that they could strengthen the group, while inner conflict quickly eroded the slowly built connection.|


**2.0 "Art is I; science is we"** ((Attributed to Claude Bernard this quote was found staring up at me from my desk months after recovering some perfectly good note writing paper from the upstairs 'Secondary Raw Materials' unMO recycling station.  It was printed in bold across the bottom of an invoice for an Arduino board!)) 


**The Rigours of the unMonastery**
"Life in the unMonastery offers a cross between an artistic residency and a spiritual retreat.  Our progression towards one-size-fits-all //praecepta vitalia// (vital precepts) has not yet reached its conclusion; the collective journey towards this wisdom shall in itself become a source of valuable knowledge. While the constraints of establishing our Matera prototype require that these precepts evolve at an inorganic pace, drawing copiously upon both historical monastic practice and the traditions of squatters can initially inform our life rhythms and decision making processes.

In choice of diet, interactive patterns and work load, we shall perhaps approach the model of self-development disciplines.  **Only our development is of the collective self.  Aspects of our individual programming shall inevitably be dropped at the door.  Work is to be done.**"((BD on the defunct unMonastery blog: post LOTE#3)) (("//What was striking is to have found the whole thought-through idea all hidden in the archives - all the concepts, challenges, and processes addressing the question how reality can be changed by acting differently, by carrying oneself with gravity and seriousness so as to force the environment to transform, like an actor. As it is only bad actors who act "like", and don't stay themselves, transformed, the whole theory goes full circle: in order to change anything, one must become such a good actor that she can transform herself through action, into a real new herself, in the not yet transformed environment, and that will bring on the actual change. There was a whole theory of action for the unMonastery, and we did not use it. We did not even raise the question of role play in correlation to creating the future, neither intellectually nor in practice.//"))


== 3.0 Where does the unMonk’s residency coalesce?: via the strengthening of inner group powers; in the cultivating of one-to-one alliances; through the building of a cultural matrix of genuine, effective exchange. ==



"//There will always be a social pedagogical component to our unMonastery work -- since we don’t actually have several centuries of practice to point the way, if we are even to approach becoming a ‘We’, we needs must actively retrain ourselves as unMonastery material.    Our structural adjustment devices weren’t many: sleeping in dormitories and celebrating collective mealtimes could round off some of our edges.  Initially, we spent considerable time in meetings learning to locate one another on the map.  Planning in concert seemed a conscious way of building a unity of purpose.  Not everything was attended to.


The need to polish each other up became so evident that it was easily avoided. We weren’t here to systematically build an ideal society, we would rather adapt to one another as little as strictly necessary.  Demands that suggested how we should interact were not to be decreed from above, but to be absorbed from our experience.  That we predicated the merit of our work to be measurable by our service component was meant to forestall naval gazing; impulses to indulge in collective introspection were from time to time shot down.  Our capacity to cherish one another was stimulated by our various degrees of beautifulness, but lacking a social mandate code to pursue such things, we couldn’t process this into realms of ecstasy.//" ((notes BD april))


**Cultivating the We**  
//"These guilds are more than work teams; they are also totem mask societies and carnival families that permeate all levels of society and promote lateral relationships across habitual social pathways."// ((Kei Kreutler in the draft manuscript of **Stakeholder's Handbook**, Jan. 2015.)) 

"The role of “Art” ((should this not be 'the arts' ? -KH)) ((absolutely not. - BD)) in the house fell rapidly far down the hierarchy of needs.  Warmth, food and healthy air took precedence over self-expression; so did installing a stable 24 hour internet connection, and getting an 'all-things-to-all-people' website up and running.  My contribution fell to the sneak attacks of guerilla warfare: a bad joke here, holding short speeches at our more formal dinners, rewriting the occasional wad of text.  I arose earlier than most to lead a 0745 awakening session discretely dubbed ‘morning practice’.    

This continued in one form or another for two months before I, heartbroken by the lack of discipline displayed by the younger generation, could no longer find the motivation.    At its best it was highly magical.  In twenty short minutes, the stiff and grumpy among us would emerge from our exploration of our collective creativity invigorated and viscerally convinced that they were involved in 'a beautiful experiment'.   Even without specifically articulating its deeper objectives,((NB: Some people purport to require the cognitive fix gained by 'specifically articulating deeper objectives'. -KH)) the morning mix of intersecting exercises did it’s work of welcoming the entire individual for an energy booster that almost by coincidence **‘magnified the We’**.     



**Landing, Lurching, Launching**
"The Matera Prototipo behaved as unMonasteries everywhere.  The initial landing phase that involved locating any available source of hot water and becoming intimate with the fuse box, gently eased into a period of apparent //paralysis//.  Buoyed only by their residual unFaith and the collective commitment to make the most of our culinary skills, the unMonks seemingly cowled in their cowls.  The accompanying phase of Culture Shock became reinforced as we absorbed the realities of our concentric //Vows of Deprivation//.  To emerge again as a cohesive, coherent band of devotees would indeed be a tall order.
