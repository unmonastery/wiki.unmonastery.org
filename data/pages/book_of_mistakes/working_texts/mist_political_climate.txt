====== Political Climate ======


== 1.0 It is in the nature of perspective than one requires the desired distance.  It is the nature of life that it is immediate.   It may have been the stones… ==


|We tried to understand the political, social, economical context. The hectic time frame of the unMonastery prototype did not allow much time for reading, but still, it proved to be very useful to become familiar with the history of the city and the region. Current local politics is one thing, deeply embedded historical reflexes and hard-wired suspicion is another. We were not there to fix the problem of the South, but we had to be aware of it.|


From time to time the unMonastery work bordered on the scandalous.  Our tradition of untraditional traditions could provoke distain. Plugging the holes in our image would prove an endless task...
     
    
1.0 In a mirror image of the unMonastery process, as we left the building another set of parallel challenges were wrestled back into community hands: **"Much as the inhabitants of the unMonastery approached the idea of community service via rejecting a core religious premise of monasticism, the strength of this alternative citizens' cultural initiative lies in being built upon a healthy scepticism towards top-down, hyper conceptual solutions grounded in blind faith. That a broad group of concerned citizens set themselves the task of producing a parallel unofficial cultural program even before what they presumably consider the — corrupt, elitist, self-appointed — MT2019 committee have revealed the details of their ‘official’ proposal, adds further testimony to the value and integrity of this initiative.  The unBidders are independently working the same ground from scratch: answering the same core thirty questions."** (([[http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/25/creative-deconstruction/]]))

//" Siamo rimasti molto contenti che avete pubblicato nel vostro newsletter informativo notizie della nostra “Top Secret” video della tecnica unMonastery di calci reciproci. Purtroppo, l'edizione che si è visto era solo per scopi di formazione interna ed gli è stato, ahimé, dato il titolo irrispettoso di "unMonkies Go Mad" da uno dei nostri collaboratori che non aveva mangiato abbastanza pesce .   Esso sarebbe stato più propriamente intitolato "Saggi uomini esercitano l´antidoto contra la mentalità burocratica " . In esso si dimostra un valido strumento utile a tutti i livelli della gestione del personale . La chiave è il riconoscimento che il nostro collettivo 'bisogno di incoraggiamento' va in entrambe le direzioni; ogni azienda dovrebbe impostare il proprio tempo tale che i boss abbino la disponibilitá sia di amministrare e di ricevere un tale scambio dai loro dipendenti, e eventualmente dai propri familiari. La nostra ricerca ha indicato che più di molte persone all'interno e all'esterno della Basilicata potrebbero certamente trarre i benefici di un calcio veloce nel culo.    
   
Questo metodo è parte del progetto ‘Propaganda non tossica’ che ha lo scopo di andare oltre i nostri limiti psicologici comuni . Il 15 di Marzo, a la festa di apertura ‘casa aperta’ di unMonastery, abbiamo presentato alcune delle nostre ricerche che sottolineano questa affermazione . Secondo i nostri risultati una nuvola di negatività incombe su una certa percentuale di Materani ( cfr. http:// --- il video della Strategia Strasburgo della Gestione della frustrazione )  http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/05/il-livro-dell-errori-iii/

//Come Materani in esilio, nessuno conosce le brave persone di Matera come a voi. Il UNMO non può pretendere di bandire questa nuvola di negatività né durante la notte né senza "invasioni positivi volontarie" da parte dei nativi . Una tale invasione positivo si è svolto questo ultimo Sabato. Sessanta Materani di tutte le età hanno superato i pregiudizi che possono avere assorbito e sono scesi sulla UNMO per un workshop pratico nella progettazione del software ‘open source’ per festeggiare il compleanno di Arduino . Non una sola di esse hanno richiesto un calcio di qualsiasi tipo .   https://vimeo.com/90660211

"We were most pleased that you published our **Top Secret unMonasterian Mutual Booting Technique video** in your informative newsletter.   The edition that you saw was really only meant for internal training purposes and has unfortunately been given the disrespectful title //“unMonkies Go Mad”// by one of our own co-workers who had __not been eating enough fish__.    It should more properly titled //“Clever Men Exercise the Antidote to Bureaucratic Mentality”//.  In it we demonstrates a valuable tool useful in all levels of personnel management.   The key is the acknowledgement that our collective //‘need for encouragement’// goes both ways; that every business and family should set off time for bosses to both administer and receive such an exchange from their employees.  **Our research has indicated that more than several people both within and outside of the region of Basilicata could most certainly have benefit of a swift kick in the arse.**


This method is part of a larger //Non-toxic Propaganda// project designed to get beyond our common psychological constraints.  At the unMonastery's open house on March 15th we presented some of our research that backs up this statement.  According to our findings - a cloud of negativity hangs over a certain percentage of Materani ( see [[http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/05/il-livro-dell-errori-iii/]] the **video of the Strasbourg Frustration Management Strategy**.) 


As Materani-in-exile no one knows the good people here like you do.   The unMo cannot be expected to banish this cloud of negativity overnight nor without //'voluntary positive invasions'// by the natives.  One such positive invasion took place this last Saturday.  Sixty Materani of all ages overcame any prejudices they may have absorbed and descended upon the unMo for a practical workshop in open source software design to celebrate the birthday of Arduino.  Not a single one of them required a kick of any sort.   If any of your readers are in town for the Pasqua week, do please visit us in the Complesso del Casale."

**Paradoxical Therapy**  Homeopathy works thusly: like repels like; to stimulate healing one ingests disease. The unMon incursion into the political climate of its 'host' community is complex.  Are we self-declared parasites feeding upon the decline of more noble institutions?  There to stimulate the healing process, it may just be that we ignite the defence mechanism of: // 'We can do that for ourselves, thank you very much.'//  If so, nothing can be more of a triumph.
   
    
==== Militant Reluctance - A People and their Myths ====

"A mystical backlash accompanied our presence in Matera.  We would of course profess our innocence of any imperialistic ambitions, but a significant segment of the population stood against the very existence of such a foreign entity as the unMonastery in the primo real estate of their city.  Days after the first unMoaner souls set foot in the Mediateca to make our fledgling inquiries a video appeared on the YouTube purporting  to cover the existence of a serial killer preying upon unsuspecting unMonasterians.  Even those whom one could consider close personal friends could embrace you as an individual while repelling the very idea.  The Materani would proudly be a hard nut to crack.

Having made a study of the Canadian congenital twins of anti-imperialistic resistance and provincialism, it was possible to slice the Matera cake generously.  A people beset by waves of historic opposition could legitimately harbour skepticism to things other, but had not the modern love of eclectic cross-over and globalised culture made it to these parts?  Were we unMonasterians not a blessing that would help lift clouds of inbred mutual self-censure?  Would the manner in which we embraced one another in-house echo the manner in which we were embraced across our interface with the locals?

We weren’t the first wave of upstarts.  Centralised government had done its well-meaning cynical best.  A region whose idealogical composition had consistently voted far to the left of the hegemonic coalition clusters that had hampered the country for 60 years would hardly be rewarded for its loyalty.  At best they would be treated as an eccentric Uncle with hygiene issues - if there was hard work to be done, they’d get the nod, but they were not to be invited to the prettier feasts.  Resentment became entrenched.

Perhaps the foulest rejection was reserved the least cognitive invaders from the North.  In times of plenty, these would claim a familiar, cultural bond between all who applied the same postage stamps.  However, obtuse Northerners would never quite grasp the allergic reaction with which they were not embraced.  Even when the ‘foreigner’ in question was genetically a re-immigrant, removed from the soil of their ancestors for no more than the generation necessary to befuddle their dialect, the atmosphere at the frontier could easily turn toxic.  The pain of cycles that exported favorite brothers to greener pastures sat deep in those left behind.  Among those left behind, fierce civic pride guarded the primary virtue of survival.

**//"Affrona i tui Errori faccia a faccia"//**   

The central myth of Matera is Madonna della Bruna.  Every year exiled citizens flock to their ancestral home for a reenactment of an historical event.  (See my Rehearsing Police Brutality with Andrea Semplici’s wonderful photo essay. ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/07/14/deconstructing-the-bruna-ritual-police-brutality/)) ) The detail of the day is glorious; however, no one can convincingly articulate its deeper significance.  Why must the magnificent, beautiful ‘caro’(chariot) be torn asunder?    

In the political climate fought out between the squadrons of social innovators and cultural preservationists in Matera someone would always be the victim.  Pomp and self-glorification would be inevitably encounter bitter reality.  The battle cry of //‘Death to the State’// was hardwired into the neurological pathways of the man in the street.  Every magnificent idea paraded in from the North was viewed as a //caro//; without even having to assess repercussions, the //caro// was to be demolished."
