====== The un ======


* "//the un is a very treacherous tool.//" ((KH in chat 1.09.2014))


|Inspired by the model of medieval monasteries, the unMonastery nevertheless tries to steer clear of some aspects of the reference: the religion, the hierarchy, the strong association with power because of their relationship to the Catholic Church. Hence the liberal application of the "un" in all the preparatory materials for the first prototype.|

It is written:

//Concealed beneath the rim of the table was the unMentionable fact that until the hose was attached to the water supply of the citizenry, it was virtually useless…//



===== unPacking the un: =====

The absence of anything gives little food for Archeologists. As Ola threw together the visuals for the logo and flashed it up on his laptop, Ben wrote out UNMONASTERY in upper case. It was respectfully suggested that UN was already an established brand name, we ought to go more quietly. Since that moment the unMo prefix has preceded us. We are in equal parts haunted and liberated by what we aren’t…

The power of the unMonastery has always been its explosive associative matrix. As soon as its flag had been unFurled at Edgeryders' first Living on the Edge gathering, Strasbourg - (LOTE#1) the core idea has attracted visionary extensions. 
**That we would be ‘a monastery’ without being a ‘monastery’ was immediately compelling; the very words ignited the imagination.** But, while the purity and purposefulness of an unMonkish lifestyle was a key to something, — what would we jettison from the monastic tradition? ((We were not hearty monks descending into the seasonal trickle of the Gravina for our weekly dunk in its fetid waters full of organic runoff of  surrounding agriculture.  Nor had we carved ourselves an additional steam room cave for ritual cleansing.  Fasting was not exactly 'The Party Line'.)) ((Nathan Schneider who visited the unMonastery in perhaps its bleakest period wrote an article which further fabulates upon un-ism. [[http://www.thenation.com/article/181398/can-monasteries-be-model-reclaiming-tech-culture-good?page=full]]))

At LOTE#2-Bruxelles we collectively devised the first snippets of //**The Lore of the unMonastery**//. In a wing of the fortified palace of the EU commissioners, old faces and meteoric appearances hacked our history in true Edgeryders’ fashion. The global precedents of monasticism became merged into a collective document created on a battery of laptops. We fantasied a life within walls dedicated to work and service that would give body to the lofty ideas that the ER gatherings inevitably spouted. As we worked, readily transferable concepts and hierarchies clustered around our increasingly impressive conceptual edifice. We flirted with the attractive disciplines of poverty and penance, of the ardurousness of matins and vespers. The unMonastery was to be our unPrecedented experimental workshop for building the **Real Stuff**.

With time there were further conversations. Words such as unSanctified and unConventional filled the unAtmosphere. What we meant by all this remained for the future to determine, but a deeper question went unAnswered: //If we are not-pious, not-self-sacrificing, non-believers, how can we work [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_challenges|very real miracles]]?// ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/29/unpacking-the-un/))((Hidden perhaps even deeper was the unresolved question: to discipline or not to discipline. Link to ...unDisiplined is hardly a selling point.))  
   
|In practice, separating desirable associations from the unUseful proved to be a difficult call; monasticism as a model, rather than a set of tools to pick and choose from, is closer to a tightly interwoven system of relationships between all of its associated concepts; a sensitively balanced habitat. We needed to adapt it to our specific principles, instead of adopting a few of its characteristics. |
