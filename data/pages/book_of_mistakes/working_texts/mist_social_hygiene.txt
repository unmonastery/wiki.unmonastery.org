====== Social Hygiene ======


== 1.0  It is written that we have not rules but aesthetics - what is appropriate behaviour is a subjective interpretation of a universal standard.==

Sharing a chemical reality with a small circle of people is just that; the intake by one effects the others.  Any statement of an ideal impinges upon traditional freedoms.  

|The motivation for joining an unMonastery leans more towards a dedication to work and ideals than towards a life-changing transformation of the self.  Having no established rules, we simply ran experiments on restrictions of some of our unhealthy habits, but they did not last very long.|

**
 "People arrived at the gates with their habits intact.  Addictions to caffeine, nicotine and the bonhomie of pub life were not shed in a day.  Some people regularly checked their e-mail and/or absorbed the flesh of our fellow creatures.  If desirable these things could change.
In the harsh world of negotiating the 'Order of an unOrder' it is hard to avoid disorder.**((March report))  




===== An Emotional Report – The unMonastery 23 days =====

"The unMonastery Prototype Matera started with at least one tremendous advantage. The initial crew of unMonasterians that slid through the recruitment process and landed pounding at the gates, were a super selection of adult human beings.  With small variations in individual strong points, we proved willing and able to exhibit understanding and patience in the face of several frustrating factors.  Not only was not every last detail in place for the theoretical Feb.1st moving-in-day, but several key systems exhibited signs of cantankerousness within days of the upstart.  Faced with this quirky beginning, our crowd showed themselves to be generous, creative and not the least, flexible.  Our working principle was soon articulated as //‘We Trust in the Process’//."((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))

"...Are we reduced to psychic wrecks a mere three weeks after our first nights in our traditional home?  Signs of strain are apparent, renewal is still possible.  The characteristic unMo stress response has been to work harder: //“Il nostro duro lavoro sará tanto leggendario quanto i nostri baccanali.”//  With the pivotal resource of **[[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_the_kitchen|the Queen of the House]]**  hopefully soon in place, we exhibit all signs of acclimatising with considerable success until at least the next wave of initiates makes their appearance…"((

"... he just presided over The Stone Age which he champions as a vital period of chill.  Meanwhile rumour in the town (and at the comitato) has us a bunch of reprobates.  Lots to do."


=====The Demon Drink =====
The Edge we Ryde explores survival strategy.  Its primary concern has always been social cohesion.  The resources invested by ER to gather our brains imply a social contract that we are to provide access to our brains at their perkiest:

**Three Case Histories:   
Strasbourg** -- Numerous Edgeryders find the city's historic towpath and local beer store, police come.  Significant percentage (30%?) of our number march in two hours late next morning missing the local organisers well-chosen ritual for downsizing rhetoric.  Embarrassing.

**Brussels** -- Edgeryders purportedly launch a drinking contest between among others Iceland and Russia: results inconclusive.  No established correlation between this occurrence and an ill-flavoured argument with venue host.  Significant percentage (writer guilty as charged, although more a transit issue with tram #5) of participants exhibit diminished levels of creative listening the next day.  Shame, shame.

**Matera 2013** -- Lively use of the town’s short distance wine industry and charming piazza life beckon.  Key cultural event slides off program largely unnoticed; late night disturbance at favorite hostel; incongruously irate yoga master.  Marked 3rd day sag with appreciable amounts of inelegant discussion practice.  OMG

Is the alcohol fueled abandon of Northern Europe the Edge we choose to Ryde?  Many of us have already researched this path sufficiently to supply refined reports of its viability.  Are there indeed better ways of managing our brainpower?  Several proposals are pursuable...

^proposal                ^ramifications ^    
|1.  Flying the banner of total temperance? |Culturally insensitive, not desirable ||   
|2.  Limit each café session to one unit?   |Useful, requires self discipline ||   
|3.  ER exercise ‘only drink with meals’ policy? |Useful, requires self discipline ||   
|4.  Late October is prime olive picking time. |The unMon has contact with local biodynamic oil producer. It may be possible to arrange a woofing exchange where a small team of the dedicated put in several days of hard work.  ( His payrate in € is unimpressive; in primo quality oil much more attractive.)  The oil inhibits alcohol absorption. ||  
|5.  ER adopt time zones - no drink after 2400.  |Desirable, requires self discipline ||    
|6.  Wait and see if participants have matured since last year. |Easy to implement ||    
|7.  We circulate this page and let things ryde? |A pathetic compromise that can easily dominate ER platform airwaves for several vital weeks and leave the proposal generator badly ostracised.-- Requires no self-discipline. || 
|8.  The unMonasteriani become recognisible by the fact that they each carry a small 2 centiliter stemmed schnapps glass on a small cord around their necks.  This is demonstrate to our generous hosts, barkeeps and to our good selves that we partake culturally but with acute awareness. |Might work, looks right silly. ||
