====== Thinking Strategically  ======


== 1.0 In the art of community development, one is advised to proceed gingerly.  To assure that the mission's work corresponds with genuine/perceived needs - one establishes ones existence through ones own projects, and then waits (patiently) for the community to figure out how they can use you.  After that the true collaboration / cross fertilisation can occur.  In the end, one can retreat almost unnoticed as the local population now runs a viable concern. ==

== The unDo ==

It is an elemental truth in community service that to do anything at all is to risk censure.  Everything one launches promotes a reaction; filling empty space implies that the space shouldn’t have been empty in the first place.  //To do// is a critique of passivity.  In the face of the seemingly valid lessons in surrender, apathy and fatalism that have inevitably adhered to a society, unilaterally breaking the negotiated stalemate between hope and possibilities is often read as an insult to someone somewhere.

The unMonastery functions as an injection of enthusiasm.   We may or may not be naive, but we routinely assume a classic naive posture: we are here to give.  If we are alert, we may recognise that we have little we can effectively give.  The classic progression as formed by René Dumal states //“Recognising we have little we desire to give of ourselves, in desiring to give of ourselves we may realise that we are nothing.  Finding that we are nothing we desire to become, in desiring to become, we begin to live.”//  But the modern doer is not trained to begin at the beginnning.  Postulating that we should ideally arrive empty handed may amount to yet another insult.  It is no wonder that //humility// is an illusive virtue. (( The art of unDoing appeared most clearly as we wrestled our presence out into the genuine stream of local Materan life.  That which had a harsh beginning found an elegant high point in our community outreach model :  [[http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/|Una Giornatta a Piccianello.]] ))



**The unMonastery model is a tactical response to a world in collapse.  To successfully establish ourselves anywhere implies standing astride societal fault lines.  For some we will always be on the wrong side.**


**Fun is fun**
Timing is also everything.  The best laid plans can explode too soon or drag on into ignominy.  Aligning initiatives with their intended goal is never infallible, but some articulation of a goal is a definite asset.  To do something because it is there to do, can easily run one into the territory of becoming mistook.

An energetic novice arrived at our doorstep.  We looked fun, maybe we were PhD fodder, things seemed happenable.  Activities could be launched with vigour.  Lacking the stable forum of the circle, or perhaps the habit of absorbing the ‘collected wisdom of the group’, an underarticulated  (( //“It's basically on-spot acting therapy to bring non-existent bridges into existence among your target audience,  creating temporal liminal zones for spectators to self realize while engaging in meaningless play.”// e-post JA -> BD 08.06.14))  highly visible projection of what appeared the unMonastery ethos literally hit the streets. Hardly a massive bomb, it merely misfired small-time, but the smoke still stung the eyes of several.  A grand idea missed its moment by a good couple of months.  While those close by caught the ‘human warmth’ intended; those with more perspective, lost it.

The **Pisolino Libero** Movement rapidly became an issue of human rights and freedom of artistic expression all stretched over the rack of political correctness like.  Had it but taken the time to reflect upon itself enough to acquire an element of ‘poetical correctness’, it wouldn’t have collided so with people’s impatience.  Freedom of expression is really only of interest under repression, otherwise it can easily revert to applied blather.

As I recall, it was on the very day of a mass slaughter on the other side of the Mediterranean.  While the world rebounded in shock, representative unMoaners, unWired from global media, took to the streets ferociously protesting something so unPalatable as the lack of nap time.  Maybe I got it wrong: the YouTube reportage had them cheerily provoking police hilarity.  However, as a project it clearly lacked a bass line.  As an //‘installation of the self’//, they were innocents abroad without a mission.  Reaction was, as they say, not long forthcoming:


**"After six months camping out in the Sassi, all they have to show us is how to take naps in the Piazza VV."** (( Ross.Cervellera, Gazetta del Mezzogiorno, 21.06.14))   

As a parable for a common opinion of the unMon operation, the Free-nappers were unCunningly accurate: for some we had ‘lounged about on prime urban real estate’ for months; now we were flaunting it.  For the culturally hyper-sensitive we were rubbing their noses in it; for those whose lot is was to defend us staunchly we were indefensible; those hungry for scandal need but sharpen their knives and forks.  

The timing was off:  if you are trying to get the locals into bed for meaningful exchange, it is clearly a sign of emotional immaturity, or at best a pathetic variant of cuteness, if you make your first fumbling moves on the evening before you leave town.  (( Wise words of warning had been proffered: //The circus in it appeals to me: purely dramaturgically I'd write it up as scenarios as to how unMoaners hit town and introduce themselves.  It fits well into the linguistic blitz training scenario -- learn the 12 phrases necessary to be a bootblack and start from there...  It isn't really parting shot/ il grande finale material, but by all means it can be tweaked.  We need a closing ceremony --- something for you and me?//  e-post BD->JA 08.06.14))

  **2nd Guessing**      
The cure for this work was of course depth, a poetic bottom, some political resonance.   Move the action 200 meters westward to outside the Regional Administrative Bastion and something poignant may have evolved.  Had it recruited local boy scouts for service on the frontline of relieving the sleep-deprived, it might have proven a good deed.  Were the unMoaners armed with phrase books and insistently inflicting acute boredom upon passersby by practicing the inane, mechanical grasp of human interaction offered by the Grammarians, having a flotilla of handy mattresses standing by to catch the fallen should we could have approached welcome social therapy for the residents of a tourist destination.  As it was the entire unMonastery got exposed in the local newspaper and gleefully labeled //‘esperti di nulla’//.(( Ross.Cervellera, Gazetta di Mezzogiorno, 21.06.14))  Denied the enrichment process of the circle that would have aligned strategic objectives, the //Pisolino Libero// remained merely fun.



"//I'd suggest that a three year time frame would more easily house these three stages. Also it may (or may not) be easier to generate local enthusiasm for something that is going to be active for a while...? That said short visits can work, I have witnessed a very effective skills transfusion program in the Balkans where a team of facilitators working out of Wien descended upon a town with a circus tent over twelve containers that in addition to providing self-sufficiency in cooking and housing -- opened to become recording studios, printing shops etc where they offered various courses.  They did some very good work in only six weeks, though by their third year on the road they had halved the number of towns per year, and doubled their stay to 3 months.  Their most concrete contribution was to leave behind a functioning local radio station at each community."// BD -> BV  July 2012.

Issues identified in April 2014: ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/rethinking-employment-strategies-at-the-unmonastery))

  - Lack of collaboration within the unMonastery group (due to highly distributed projects)
  - Language barrier
  - Lack of capacity and support for individual projects
  - Inability to effectively onboard people in a prolonged process
  - Not enough people using the space outside of scheduled events
  - Distributed workload for the same tasks across projects




**Cooperative Project Workshop**
"Finally someone said it: during the planning meeting for week 13 of 17, the strategy that I humbly expressed prior to my descent, finally resurfaced.  It surprised even me.

The unMonastery has a potential function that goes beyond supporting individual project makers during their progressive forays into a hopefully more hospitable foreign clime.  Outreach takes years.   More to the point is that an unMonastery can quickly become an asylum that absorbs elements of the host society into our ‘free space’.  We are refuge from the known, an enhanced home for liberating activities where we, ‘the imports‘, offer a framework and a scattering of skills before stepping aside.

As such we are stronger if we don’t merely seek to attract lone wolves or black sheep, but rather groups from pre-existing organisations that can tweak their activities by applying some unMonastic strategies and techniques.  We, at our best, can operate as facilitators with a library of health bringing approaches at our fingertips.
 The unMonastey would then function as a //co-operative project workshop// - an open workspace sharing participatory practice interface in an open meeting series where all ‘residents’ are expected to contribute." ((an orphaned note under the menacing title "The Patience of Jove"))
