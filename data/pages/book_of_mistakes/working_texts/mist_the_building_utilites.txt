====== The Building & Utilities ======

|One of the founding ideas of the unMonastery is to activate existing assets and resources by clever shuffling; unused real estate is to be occupied by skilled people who refuse to or are unable to take mainstream employment options. The building housing the first prototype was temporarily unused. It was also a beautiful palace in the middle of a UNESCO World Heritage site. Tinkering and DIY solutions were discouraged. The process of making it habitable was lengthy and expensive.|


"//To stay fair I also can recall happenings which show other, not so much pro-brands tendencies. I feel very proud of @Ben that even while holding quite sensitive role during unMonastery:Matera Pilot Session #1, he said NO to attempts of our dear and beloved fanatics of Comitato Matera 2019 fame to place branding sign of unMonastery and MT2019 on a walls of Palazzo del Casale, I guess as a part of their mass propaganda campaign// #TODO tweet this.url @Matera2019 ✓" ((https://edgeryders.eu/nono-edgeryders-nono-unmonastery-nono-mt2019-sick-and-tired-of))

=== 1.0 Our intentions were crystal clear – at least to us: while the ‘unMonastery’ of our parental lineage remained an utopian ideal, we wrestled with a firmer reality.  We were the genuine article; in our heart of hearts we had indeed progressed a step further along our pathway, we were the unMonastery Prototipo Matera. ====   
      
We were battling with our key existential questions: what were the unMonasterians, who was the unMonastery?  Finally willing to throw open our gates to the multitudes, we were still fumbling to explain ourselves in two languages… On the morning of the big day, there came a pounding at our collective door – “//The good workers had arrived to put up our signs.  Where did we want them?//” The problem was that none of us had ordered any signs.  Without any of our endless rounds of indecisive discussion, something had happened; we were to be immutably corporate-branded out of the blue.  Without asking, someone somewhere had made the bold assumption that: we were who we said we were where we said we were.  Our magnificent palace of a house was to be boldly labelled “unMonastery” with the leaf-green logo that we had happily been using for the last 11 months.   Semi-understandably, we the unGrateful, were having none of it…

== Infrastructure: Putting Building Into Use - Kitchen, Heating, Internet, Furniture. ==

That things should be so easy: from the first Report to Stakeholders:

//"The first fundamental challenge of the unMonastery project in Matera has been to establish itself operationally in the building - the first month of the project was essentially written off due to dealing with infrastructural roadblocks, a combination of no heating, no internet and so forth prevented the project starting upon arrival of the first unMonasterians.((That temporary snowblindness could so invoke such a loss of perspective is a source of acute embarrassment: it was clearly stated in at least several places that sweeping up dust and the rigging of pipes were the loving labours of the first unMon year.  About this time some more alert soul hatched the 'No Complaining' as the only clause in the unMon rule book. Link ))
  
Key dates:   
4th February 	- 	Access to the building is granted.     
4th February 	- 	Heating is switched on, and works in 2 rooms upstairs.    
11th February 	-	All Furniture Arrives   
5th March 	- 	Heating is fixed downstairs.       
11th March 	-	Kitchen Issues resolved (adequate cooking equipment and work surfaces)   
   
Many issues relating to the building still persist but no longer prevent us from living in and using the building, so we’ve learnt to live with them. An overview of this is maintained in ‘unMonastery Building Status’. Whilst initially considered an impediment to the success of the unMonastery in Matera; to effectively lose over a month of operational activity. Bringing the building into full operational use during this time period should be considered one of the core successes of the project to date, an ongoing challenge is to ensure it doesn’t once again fall into disuse."//   

== Building Improvement and Manuals ==

**To responsibly assure that no one else need repeat all our steps a rigorous catalog of practical issues was created:**   
 
//As is the tradition of the unMonastery we have been religiously documenting the various mechanics of the building, from the core infrastructure (gas, electrics, water) through to key management (of keys -ed.) and waste disposal. As a key artifact of the unMonastery’s use of the building, a full manual for the building will be compiled, with accompanying videos will be left with the building and online. So to ensure that the knowledge derived from our time here stays with those come to use the building in the future and no one ever has to have a cold shower here ever again.// ((http://unmonastery-wiki.mirelsol.org/doku.php?id=building_manual))
