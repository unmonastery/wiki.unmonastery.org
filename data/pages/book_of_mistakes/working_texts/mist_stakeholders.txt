====== Stakeholders ======  

|Every project starts with a few people or groups investing time, work, personal credibility and sometimes money in order to get it off the ground. The unMonastery had a long history even before the prototype in Matera first appeared as a possibility: several Edgeryders participated in the conception, embellishment and design of the model. Senior Edgeryders' personal involvement landed unMonastery in Matera with a building and a budget to run for 4 months. The city put up the money; the group of citizens who ran the bid for the Cultural Capital of Europe 2019 title, and needed a novel way to open up the city towards Europe, took the personal risk of losing their reputation and being accused of wasting taxpayer money, by supporting the project. | 

"Among the Lost volumes buried beneath a mountain of e-mails covering this developmental stage is the pivotal //"Stakeholders Guide to the unMonastery"//.  Scholars suggest that the material it purportedly covered can be sufficiently triangulated by surviving documentation.  However nowhere do the unMonasterians get so thoroughly apologetic as in there."


**3.0 The unMonastery has never been a popular hit — for that it is too conceptually unDefined.  It is ‘something doing something’; its fruits won’t mature until after its doors are closed.**((http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/25/creative-deconstruction/))


**1.0 Stakeholders are the ones whose fingers get smashed when the full force of the sledge hammer doesn't quite hit the stake they are gamely holding in place.**


"//For front facing communication/feedback channels we also can improve our strategy. I remember discussion when @Nadia visited us about various stakeholders, I must admit that many of them make me think about Yeti and give impression that to get feedback from some of them we use gossip protocol, not sure intentionally or accidentally// ;)" ((https://edgeryders.eu/urgent-can-someone-hand-me-some-toilet-paper-please)) 

   
"Not understanding the implications, unMonasterians turned against each of their supporters at one point or another. The question is far from resolved: the expectations around the unMonastery were contradictory and unclear, the conversations full of frustration and disappointment, and the technique of resolving conflicts in a peaceful and respectful way immediately forgotten once it came to the people who had a vested interest in our activities. Ranging from shortsighted impatience to cowardice, we practiced the entire range of immature response to expectations." ((KH - extended signposts ))

"//Stakeholders - it is more about our reluctant and slow recognition that we need to pay attention to MT2019 and their needs. I remember that in early February, I tried to understand the immediate goals, and found that "we" (a movement lead by elf and strongly supported by Ben - and you) did not care a bit about the "challenges" - the projects and MT2019's motivation to fund the project. I felt confused, not having had a lot of experience with ER hackathon style dream-projects without any connection to reality. [In art you always have to deliver. The opening date is not moveable, the problems are a source of creative invention, and there is no such thing as *complaining*. It does not even need to be lawed out, there is no point, the gallery will not change its inner workings for a single show, materials will not be cheaper, the funding will not get bigger, and it is only your career that gets harmed if you don't deliver.] So. Stakeholders is about reality. Money, the bid. Stakeholders can also be about Edgeryders. In fact it would be a great thing to think about, whether ER as a community enjoying immaterial endless freedom to TALK can ever be a stakeholder? Talking is not a stake. ER the company is a real stakeholder, and was forced to back down a few times//."((KH letter to BD, September 2014)) 


"To help stir up a ground-swell of enthusiasm just prior to the March 2013 //'Meet the Community'// gathering at (Matera) Mediateca to chart out the main concerns of local citizens that might be appropriate for the unMonastery to address, I stepped forward for an online interview with Carlo who posed a typically gracious and diplomatic Matera-style question.   Accounting for several generations of translation and the vagaries of my memory it popped out something like: //**“How should the Materiani prepare for your arrival?”**//  — I tried to summons my line as a realist.  I requested that: //Above all that they try not to be perfect.  We were coming to make mistakes and to learn from them.  It would suffice that they were customary fallible human beings much like those whom we find in our home countries.//  As I recall, I even suggested that those among them with bureaucratic tendencies be allowed to exercise them..."((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))



"Without any of our endless rounds of indecisive discussion, something had happened; we were to be immutably corporate-branded out of the blue. Without asking, someone somewhere had made the bold assumption that: we were who we said we were where we said we were. Our magnificent palace of a house was to be boldly labelled “unMonastery” with the leaf-green logo that we had happily been using for the last 11 months. Semi-understandably, we the unGrateful, were having none of it…
   
Behaving like naughty children, we became treated as naughty children. In a fit of adolescent hubris we declared independence, and psychically moved beyond the range of parental influence at first opportunity." ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))

The founding of the Matera School of the unMonastary is a sacred trust. 
If successful, the work laid down to nurture the health of unMonastery Prototipo Matera, will place the city back on the world map as a cultural hub and reference point as the unMonastery movement continues to spread and generate excitement.  The unique character of the city as to size and its short distance to sustainable living patterns as well as some of the uninterrupted cultural traditions provide a model for future living everywhere.
