====== Play -  very, very, very Serious Play ======

==1.0  We must also live slowly into our form: building only as we uncover our buried inner needs.==  


//"A young Materani explained to me the career options in the area.  There are two major fields of study offered at the local university: the town is obviously full of architects, it also has a very high concentration of archeologists.  I am thinking that as much as building a new community within an old one, we should look at our work as unearthing an old community while belonging to the new one.  This point of balance may be the Edge we are looking for.

Archeologists dig slowly.  Sometimes they use no more than a slim brush or their breath to remove the layers of time.  We must also live slowly into our form: building only as we uncover our buried inner needs.  To enter into this dialog with the wall (and the inherent) memories of the Matera caves, resembles the communion necessary before donning the shamanic mask: we absorb the spirit of millennia of inhabitants; allowing them to govern our beings and our interaction.  It is not unlikely that we must grunt, dance and sing before we can produce any well reasoned statement of mutual agreement."//


|The unMonastery is predicated upon a scenario which is halfway between the present and the future. The breakdown of social services: education, healthcare for the disabled or elderly, not to mention providing solutions to counterbalance social and economical disparities within society is apparent. The urgent need to find solutions is not. To act "as if" there is a crisis is different from acting in the midst of catastrophe.|


**Souls in a scenario**  

//"It seems that once upon a time I threw all the elements of my beloved theatre into a pot on the back of the stove.  Given sufficient patience and even minimal heat they would reduce themselves to the essentials. With the economy of wisdom these essentials have boiled themselves down to — raw people in a moment of heightened interaction.  I should be loath to pronounce it out-loud, but the ultimate distillation even allows that if the actors can be persuaded to people the scenario with their true selves, it isn’t even necessary to inform them that they are acting…"// ((The Hidden Theatre of the unMonastery: http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/  
"//Professional theatre artists possess certain fundamental human tools.  We know about elemental warm ups, building circles of safety; about the minimalist increments of honesty with which one constructs fresh truths.  Conflict is to be orchestrated; metaphors are our modus operandi.  Above all, we are concerned with managing the delicate transition so that both player and witness, make a breathless leap together.//"))
 
"We needed to take ourselves seriously in order to be trustable, but were we really qualified to do anything? Borrowing a few pages from the history of monasticism does not lend an ethical stance and a shared value system between a hosting community and their unMonasterians. To imagine that what we were doing had serious, long-lasting implications was necessary; play was our best tool to do it with conviction."

"//As you may have noticed, If you bothered to read all this mad ramblings, that I don't draw any clear conclusions or go in very precise directions. I see this post, besides just exercising my poor writing skills, as sort of an attempt to throw a wrench in our mental gears and encourage us all to question our mental patterns and pay attention to our habits and tendencies. Disappointed? Ha... to bad// :P" ((https://edgeryders.eu/nono-edgeryders-nono-unmonastery-nono-mt2019-sick-and-tired-of))

"//We are friends and we want to live and work together - we share a common interest, it is scuba diving, we believe that new states of consciousness  can be achieved through deep water diving. We are deeply committed to marine conservation and founded on the concept that, by sharing the wonders of the ocean and marine life, people will be inspired to protect it. It’s is a vital imperative for the conservation of the planet that all life on earth experience the transformative effects of deep sea co-living.//" ((https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qeOO83FrLZAFvBG33Ihi7IuRx-NxAipV7wPMi6Ir8to/edit))



==== Tweaking Tradition - a case study ====   
In the unMonastery palette of readily applicable solutions is the popular ritual.  This was not a foreign phenomena in Matera and despite the encumbrance of tradition can be used to generate momentum... At the foot of one wing of the original cave town that clustered around its political and ecclesiastical citadel, stands the centrepiece of the city's impressive array of 150 rupestrian carved churches, La Madonna del’Idris.  Not only does this hollowed out geological protuberance honour the patron saint of 'Hydro', it was excavated to embrace a large cistern that formed the collective water supply of the neighbourhood in times of need.

Francesco, our quickest moving unMonk, came and saw and vanished.  Certainly a believer, he embraced the unMon dream but was not about to surrender all his worldly possessions.   We would be heavily dependent upon miracles should we retain him.  That he likely spoke the aristocratic dialect of Naples and of the conquering hordes that had plundered this part of Basilicata to among other things, construct the //Versailles of the Mediterranean// in Caserta wouldn’t have spoke in his favour among the locals.  Prone to defining his world, he would have been tough meat for an initiation ritual had we had one.  His project proposal was massive and monumental.  Building upon the Matera Challenges had located the primary source of all life: regional infrastructure development funds from the EU.  His pitch was challenge #10) **Water Systems and Sustainability**   //"Water Extraction Techniques - Matera has a history and database of many existing processes, how could these be translated, built upon and potentially open sourced and redeployed as an intellectual export of Matera? Potential for developing new water catching techniques."//  

Providing an environmentally sensitive solution to all the city’s water woes was a tall order.  Historically progressive, Matera probably owed its existence to the 3rd Century cistern(( check with Antonio Acito)) that is only dwarfed by the Emperor Justinian's in downtown Constantinople  These underground systems vastly expanded upon the individual manner of harvesting run-off and condensation in the cave dwellings.  Sometime in the massive imperialistic rebuild foisted upon the South as the great promise of the Mussolini regime these underground reservoirs had fallen out of fashion.  Not only did this civic vault become filled in with rubble and buried beneath the people’s piazza, but its supply lines were cut off.  Significant upstream impediments sunk in the form of foundations for new buildings redirected groundwater flow for other uses.  ((Much to the supervising architect’s dismay when they unearthed it beneath the axis of civic pride, rather than being restored as a demonstration of sustainable technology, the choice dictated by the ethos of the 1990s was that it remain dry. (It is now a stop on the tourist parade.)

Francesco sought a big splash.  His project was threefold: exploiting the latent energy in the city’s runoff that cascaded unharnessed into the local rivulet; introduce self-cleansing micro environments along this valley to render benign the chemical incursions from upstream agriculture.  His third and perhaps realistically proportioned unMon-sized project was a permaculture model for directing local rainfall into domestic garden produce.  There to do business, his ideas soared.

==== Popular Ritual Culture First Approach ====
However his grasp  of the pulse of local players was badly askew.  He met the resistance movement head on.  When the managing head of our sponsoring body cancelled a meeting at short notice, it was annoying; when the regional director for water management cancelled a meeting at short notice, it was reason to pack ones bags.

His projects were a prime candidate for a //‘Culture First’// approach.  During our internal follow-up session in Napoli, he conceded that no one would stick their neck out to front a project with no basis in local sensibilities.  As long as taps could be opened and toilets flushed, a periodic dry spell must be good for something...

To prime the collective imperative of visionary water management requires pressure from below.  Water must become a cause.  What could better mobilse the citizenry that an annual massive **Water Fight and Dance Day** in the piazza overlooked by Madonna del’Idris?
