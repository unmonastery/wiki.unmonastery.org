====== Daily Rituals ======

"//The unMonastery imagery soars – the real time walls and vista are no less evocative.  We are most convincingly in the right place at the right time.//" ((In an article exposing his nefarious plans, the scribe lifts the curtain on his //“Hidden Theatre of the unMonastery”//.http://bembodavies.com/2014/02/22/souls-in-a-scenario/))   
   
   
|Everybody lives by rituals. The shock of creating a daily plan (our liturgy) for the unMonastery hackers was that it largely coincided with an average family with small children - getting up at 7, and going to bed at midnight. The devil was in the details: taking turns to take care of everyday chores such as cooking and garbage recycling, so each individual had many days free of the need to focus on anything else but work.  The daily 'morning practice' was designed to forge a live community out of alienated strangers, as well as an exercise that made us vulnerable in a foreign language. We held check-in and check-out circles to share how we felt, although it normally takes months to develop such intimacy with strangers (if at all). We shared mealtimes; we shared concerns.|


== 1.0 "Beyond designing a re-fit for urban geeks who haven’t yet succumbed to their gluten intolerance, the unMonastery is a service organ. We shall survive by creating inviting rhythms and rituals that allow us to embrace a life of devotion in the face of a crumbling game. Our medium must be internal human warmth. We seek to build a regime of personal acceptance and confrontation with a generous proportion of collective triumph augmented by sensual feedback. Through communion with our deepest nature – the dance, and most excellent food shall be our currency of conversion. Our vow of silence may become a periodic vow of non-verbalism." ==

"//**Liturgy - Our Daily Routine**    
We fell into a daily routine as proposed by Cristiano fairly organically. The “Liturgy” allows us to eat meals together, be present at the circles, and still be able to organise our time to work on our individual projects. Newest additions are the morning bell (at 07:00, rung by [Marc]) and morning practices (led by Bembo). Nobody is required to do anything they don’t want - but we trust in the process, that everyone seems to want to participate in the things we consider important.//" ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/life-in-the-unmonastery-a-status-update-on-living-the-good-life))   
   
The Matera unMo followed the pattern of organic growth in unknown surroundings.  To remove the fear of faltering the first iteration repeatedly reminded itself that this was a //prototipo//.  Those unused to the cultivation of the ensemble could thus be automatically conscious that their’s was a life of firsts.
   

7 february: //Initiation of the resounding Morning Bell at 0700 hours and collective lingo-physical training occurs in unseasonal sunshiny day. First dumpster diving yielded its small treasures: three marginal oranges, genuine card board for our endless need to make notices, small crates that shall become kitchen.// ((https://edgeryders.eu/unmonastery/adherent-prototype-traditions-of-the-unmo))    


== 2.0 As the fear of unAccomplishment struck the less faithful, moments of our daily ritual became abbreviated into a perhaps illegible shorthand; degrees of holiness fading into degrees of unHoliness.  ==

|We saw that it worked, and still we allowed it to disappear. The reasons are numerous: we never made any attempt to articulate the goal of each of these activities; the increasing pressure to deliver tangible results made them seem superfluous and time-consuming; the amounting criticism of some of the local groups that we spend our time building a cult rather than working - all this contributed to us dropping vital rituals that had already proved essential to becoming a "we" within the unMonastery.|

//"Traditionally, arrival at the monastery gates as a novice involved surrender.  
You gave up your name, all your worldly possessions and your hair.  
Your identity was replaced by brotherhood/sisterhood; **you became us**.  

What is our unEquivalent?
We surrender our phone and much linguistic competence: we become 'excommunicated'//."((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/8600#comment-860))
     
**Parables of the unMon II.**    
"...  //On my secret last day in Matera in the wake of the LOTE#3 gathering, I finally crossed the road.  Not to the inviting Murgia, but to the neighbouring monastery that will so dominate our view.  In the unVerifiably old sub-church that forms an invisible appendix to the XVIII Century edifice that we see daily, my path finally crossed those of our predecessors…

**How does our unWorship witness theirs?** 
The XVI Century social organs that erected these monuments reflected a spiritual currency.  At the top, the ecclesiastical aristocrats who dispersed this currency commissioned frescos left, right and above all; beneath them slaved the waves of worker nuns and monks who kept the operation churning.  Responsible for maintaining an atmosphere of religious fever and aided by generous amounts of sleep deprivation and chronic sonorous head vibration induced by all that chanting, they staggered about in sufficient perpetual euphoric rapture to keep the entire community convinced of their do-gooding.  Our version of the unHolier than thou, while it must seek this rapture, cannot afford to take shortcuts.//" 

 **The unCredo**  
"Into this morning session, I dropped one clearly ideological contribution.  A short text written before I descended (to Matera) was translated into somewhat ponderous Italiano.  It addressed several needs: beyond breaking the sound barrier from week one, the text addressed the issues facing us and the working principles that would keep us strong.  It was used religiously as a vibrant liturgy to push the energy generated under morning practice into our awareness of our mission and the linguistic challenge before us.  For those who took the trouble to learn it by heart, it offered valuable solace in times of doubt."  ((The psychopedagogics of breaking our sound barrier with a performed statement of intent are discussed under [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_language_barriers|Language Barriers]].))

**Il non-Credo delle non-Monache:**   

“Ancor non lo sappiamo,
nel frattempo lasciateci perdere.   
Affronta i tuoi errori faccia a faccia:
I sacri muri preserveranno a nostra onestà.   

Il nostro duro lavoro sará tanto leggendario quanto i nostri baccanali.   

Ci domandiamo di cosa i giusti godranno a cena ?”

//“As yet we cannot know, until that time we shall: ‘Get Lost’.   

Confront your errors, face to face -
the Sacred Walls shall preserve our integrity.   

Our hard work shall be as legendary as our Bacchanalia.   

We wonder what the Good People shall be enjoying for dinner… ?”//   
 (my rough translation)  ((This our Credo found several other applications: appearing as a mass chant at our first press conference that had the city mayor chuckling under his breath; getting written up as an impressive wall hanging for our open house ceremonies; being drawn out for recital at various dinner parties.  However, lacking any sanctioning power, this illuminating text fell into disuse as newcomers felt little curiosity as to its content, and the veterans proved insufficiently poised to convey its significance.  Last sighted, the written artifact had been shoved into a corner during some clean up process - no one appeared to take affront.))((The role of the Dance was given a similarly marginal role.  The need for dance was foreseen as a necessary source of renewal; a solid sound system had appeared on the list of ‘on-site necessities’.  However it took several weeks for it to arrive and to break the ice.  A moment or two of bopping by a couple of veterans and demonstrations of the joys of early morning contact improvisation were not enough for dance to be considered part of house culture.  By the time our naturally cavernous dance floor was well heated enough to safely enter, we had forgotten what we might have had to rejoice over.  Several months later the waves of psychic refurbishment gave signs that the treasure of the dance floor might indeed establish itself.))   


Armed with these few guiding principles, we were to set forth upon an unknown journey.  
Personal interpretations of what it all signified were encouraged...
