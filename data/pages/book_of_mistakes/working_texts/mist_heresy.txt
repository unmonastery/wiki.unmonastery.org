====== Heresy ======

|Traditionally, heretics claim simply a different road to a common goal. Heresy however requires an established doctrine. The unMonastery Matera prototype started with no rules, and ran only for 6 months, its self-definition still in the design phase. Can we claim to already have produced heretics? Methods and aspirations still fluid, unMonastery has met problems with individuals, who may or may not be occupational heretics.|


"**Inevitable Invasion of the Holy Spaces**
 The Matera unMo followed the pattern of organic growth in unknown surroundings.  To remove the fear of faltering the first iteration repeatedly reminded itself that this was a //'prototipo'//.  Those unused to the cultivation of the ensemble could thus be automatically conscious that their’s was //a life of firsts//.  However, such was the pace of developments that our community of self-governing, floundering novices had yet to acknowledge the few concrete indications of the invisible, unarticulated spiritual depth of our voyage together, before their novice status was placed under question. Forced by circumstance to welcome the unMonastery’s first substantial wave of new arrivals; it was beyond our adroitness to spontaneously promote ourselves into de facto initiates.  That fresh faces clearly need a de-tox period to negotiate their own landing should be unQuestionable.  However, with a more than full program and the absence of a blood transfusion ritual, integration was taken for granted."
      
== 1.0 We are in equal parts haunted and liberated by what we aren’t… ==

unMonastic life offers the novice realms of service through which to align their vision, but the push to form break-away reform movements that so marked the development of divergent monastic orders is dependent upon a stable and established orthodoxy from which to redefine ones divergence.

**2.0 Rules for the sake of rules are orthodoxy.  Short-sighted or dogmatic orthodoxy breeds rebellion.** (( note on ER as a community of activists ?))

    
We shrunk. It happens to all of us.  Our genius adapts to reality.  Once we hit the vast field of the work, we get dwarfed.  In an unComfortable situation,  seeking more discomfort is counter-intuitive.  Life has taught us to accept limits, we become tamed by our circumstances.  When our renewables aren’t renewed by our discipline, our vision blurs. Sister Katalin was brutal:  “//What did you do to my beloved unMonastery?//”  ((One of the first in the door she juggled family commitments to stretch her two short stints into three.  -  “In my eyes you are all heretics because you totally ruined the rituals that defined the unMonastery for me.”))

== 3.0 Uniformity is neither possible nor desirable.  Differing personalities enrich a community. However manifesting an agency of social cohesion requires concerted effort.  We pull together. ==

Individuals whose deeper psychic make-up does not readily allow for a ‘we’ require additional balance.  For various reasons stimulating this balance can become such a drain on the community as to command a disproportionate amount of attention. At vulnerable, particularly early stages of forging the ensemble, it is often necessary to say no //‘earlier than later’// to novices that exhibit chronically disharmonic behavior.  The pedagogic spin-off from taking such seemingly harsh decision can reward the flock in mysterious ways. 


===== Deprivation and the Deprived =====


In the early stumbling days of //[[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_mining_the_metaphor|Mining the unMon Metaphor]]//, the endless questioning of barely established practice was merely unRuly.((It is written in the chronicles of the unMonastery that we live less by rule than by aesthetics.  That we embrace a creed of //share and share alike// as developed in our circular family culture of evolving virtues.  **Faced with a contrary culture of irreverence, it seems a culture of irreverent contrariness.**  Adjectives could fly for less.  

The cultural conflict that has so etched the shape of the growth of unMonastery Prototipo Matera should have been caught earlier.  From one point of view the diagnosis seems clear:  the descent of uncouth North European hyper-rational technocrat louts was always an invitation to disaster. Without learning to weave the web of appropriate phrases of diplomatic polite conversation that oil the caring, generous community in which we suddenly found ourselves emerged, those trained to gracelessly hammer home their considered point of view in debating societies and chat forums could do a lot of bruising.  

That the straight from the liver style of some of the unMoaners has recently managed to repel four of five of our native Italian participants is sad proof of this tendency.  Some people may have gone anyway, but this triage is on top of alienating our primary local sponsor and primary collaborative partner.  When one favourite restaurant no longer welcomes unMonasterians with the same glee, are we perhaps doing something wrong?))  What was once a miracle, can easily be taken for granted.

Contrary to popular myth, the unMonastery does not operate by way of rules.  In our time we have enacted but one rule:  "No Complaining".  Try as we might everyone has found the capacity to break this rule repeatedly.  At all other conjunctures we have compelling aesthetics: such is the way of the unMonasterian. 

Orthodox unMonasteries have no rules.  What we do have is observances and practices: esthetic boundaries that are to be respected even as they be inevitably stretched.   
    
Traditionally novices or initiates would have paid dear to be taken into consideration for monastic life.  The act of depositing all their worldly possessions at the entrance gate was unRefundable; to be found habitually unSuitable could leave one quite literally without a suit.  Fear of non-conformability was a useful mechanism for internalising the endless layers of collective life.

Inevitably the sun would shine; unMonastic life offers the novice realms of service through which to align their vision, but the push to form break-away reform movements that so marked the development of divergent monastic orders is dependent upon a stable and established orthodoxy from which to redefine ones divergence.
