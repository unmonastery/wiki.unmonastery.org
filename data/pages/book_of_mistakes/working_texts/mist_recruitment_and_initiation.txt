====== Recruitment and Initiation ======

|In the first round of recruitment, unMonastery not being defined more clearly than as a cross section between social innovation and artists' residence, the call for proposals attracted people who were interested in "projects" - either developing unMonastery, or their project responding to the challenges. One lesson of the unMonastery Matera prototype is that culture, the way of living and doing things as unMonasterians, will and should precede the delivery of results. Have we developed and articulated our own culture in order to start a new recruitment process?| 

**Inevitable Invasion of the Holy Spaces**
The Matera unMo followed the pattern of organic growth in unknown surroundings.  To remove the fear of faltering, the first iteration repeatedly reminded itself that this was a //prototipo//.  Those unused to the 'cultivation of the ensemble' could thus be automatically conscious that their’s was a life of firsts.  However, such was the pace of developments that our community of self-governing, floundering novices had yet to acknowledge the few concrete indications of the invisible, unarticulated spiritual depth of our voyage together, before their novice status was placed under question.  Forced by circumstance to welcome the unMonastery’s first substantial wave of new arrivals; it was beyond our adroitness to spontaneously promote ourselves into de facto initiates.

That fresh faces clearly need a de-tox period to negotiate their own landing should be unQuestionable.  However, with a more than full program and the absence of a blood transfusion ritual, integration was taken for granted..." ((ref: ))  


===An Imaginative Leap too Far?:===
It is written:
"The limits of unMonastic life are legitimate.  We do indeed choose to suffer perceivable deprivation.  So much is this the case that we as palpably human beings are forced to turn to the pleasures and potential pleasures of communal living in order to renew our zeal.  Although occasions of bacchanalia are mentioned in our literature, at the moment of writing we have not yet succumbed to rites of sexual abandon.  And since neither appreciable amounts of the dance nor audible song have entered our repertoire, our renewal mechanisms are reduced to bad jokes, genuine caring and pure human warmth as shared in our two daily ritual circles and the universal sacrament of mealtimes.

The inherent conflict between our existence as a willing service institution and the more central experiment as a lifestyle choice is now under trial.  Repulsed by our insularity some seek refuge in the fleeting pleasures of fieldwork; while others, perhaps feeling dissatisfied with the superficiality of their field presence, retreat to the confines of the manageable chores within the unMo walls.  By-passing one another has now become a routine occurrence.  The unMonastery has sprung a leak…

The clearest manifestation of leakage is in our legendary //Morning Practice//.  This may not be the only diagnostic window on the health of our order; it is however ridiculously easy to count the attendant heads.  Despite the impressive documentary footage shot by a radio-steered helicopter on the morning of our Grande Opening Feast, we have only once celebrated full attendance.  The assembled non-multitudes do the best they can, and almost routinely lift their somewhat comatose morning spirits to levels of minor euphoria.  **However, we have yet to articulate the value of this activity in integrating and consolidating the collective.  Instead of something one meets keen, prepared and eager, it has been reduced to serving as an optional augmentation to the wake-up call.  Few have proven willing to see beyond their own precious selves in this equation — not reckoning that their negative presence inevitably subtracts from the positive and that those who do choose to re-invent our fellowship in concentric flights of visceral fancy, do so in the shadow of those who succumb to temptation of another 20 minutes under the warm sheets.**  It is noted that the absentee rate from breakfast is appreciably lower.  ((as pointed out by KH: the significance of daily collective renewal was never articulated.  It was left to the swarms to intuit the //why// we were doing this from //how// it asked us to interact; many people, unused to, say, an actors psycho-social preparation, got stuck on the //what// we were doing.  While it was not physically strenuous, it could often approach the outer limits of the imagination.))

That this heartbreaking dis-integration is not subject to alarm is in itself alarming.  **The investment in the ensemble is the duty of every unMonasterian.**   It is certainly something worth getting out of bed for.  In the pre-unMo literature this challenge was designated as //“Creating the We".//  For the ego-bred urbanite such an investment in our own //‘intergratity’// seems not to be second nature.  Can a certain zeal be renewed without resorting to inorganic strategies?  Fortunately, we can turn to the wonderful world of paradoxical therapy that suggests us that for the chronically tired, one trick is to awaken earlier.((The scribe is clearly faltering here  -- any speculations as to why would be gladly appreciated.))

We wake up. We attend to those we live with. Exercises of strengthening the individual and group are either explicit or implicit. Nourishment is prepared from among the stores; should these moments of mutual care be combined into one ritual? Do they require strengthening through song, dance or prayer?
    
A choice may be available: what shall be my carbo-social footprint for today? Shall I engage in survival - gather wood for the days ahead, or am I investing in the future - engaged in collective activities that spread our collective capacity to negotiate constructively with our surroundings?
    
The fallback compromise is, of course, business as usual: fed by the hand that bites us, embracing our individual interface with the current grid of institutions for as long as they retain their capacity to deliver the goods. How long we can continue to reap the pleasures of our habitual bonus agreements, is the backdrop which the entire FWD project illuminates. Will we leap willingly into the future, or be shoved?
   
Does this moment of daily compromise too need its ritual? A communal rite of contrition/forgiveness that allows each of us another year in the clutches of these pernicious bonus agreements. Or better, a harvest feast acknowledging breakthroughs both social and psychic, and designating the priorities for the next period. Do these also require strengthening through spiritual cleansing and carnival?
