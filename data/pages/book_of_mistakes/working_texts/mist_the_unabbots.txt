====== The unAbbots ======

|One of the most difficult aspect of setting up the unMonastery was the question of authority. (( Is this political, moral or religious authority you point to?)) More prone to stick to the myth of structurelessness rather than to address the complex issue of efficiency and hierarchy, the prototype has gone through numerous transformations in which valuable new traditions were lost, simply because noone dared to claim to know better. The incredible amount of material produced by the Edgeryders community before opening the first unMonastery remained largely useless because the few who knew of its existence and understood its value did not take on the role of experts. ((Although the information was available to all,  only few people possessed the power to use it. The archives point to a definitive solution: a stronger focus on skill sharing and knowledge distribution, not by pointing to deposits, but by a personal dedication to structuring and contextualising the information. The individual struggle of all the people whose name turned up as potential unAbbots stands as a reminder that although having leadership is not avoidable, going it alone is.))|

"//I strongly ask that all unMonasterians focus on getting results. Results are defined by what you can show with pride to an external person.//" ((https://edgeryders.eu/politics-at-the-unmonastery-a-meditation-and-an-exhortation))

"//The last week has been hard, I have too much to say on this matter in a moment in which I'm exhausting myself in the process of getting 'the results' - in what has felt like a significantly lonely and difficult position throughout. Equally not the type of experience I expected from a year working towards a beautiful idea.  I will save my thoughts, lessons and mistakes for a time when they can be productively compiled and reflected upon. The only way I can recognise such a pledge of responsibility is for a role shift, if you're prepared to take the role of unAbbott in the project I welcome your lead and the opportunity to offer exhortation from a distance. This is not meant as provocation but rather the desire to seek clarification and what I recognise as a desperate need for the continuation of the unMonastery; that those directing from outside the project to experience the process first hand in order to better put an idea into practice at scale.//" (Ben, in response to Alberto) ((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11651#comment-11651))   
    

Under the title "Ancient History" the sudden invocation of the previously silent 'unAbbot' role was commented upon in the Edgeryders/Viral Academy pages: ((https://edgeryders.eu/comment/11084#comment-11084 ))    
   
"//The furor of the last few days may abate --  Good steps have been taken, a key unit seems to be there ready to fall into place, but I still possess my fears.  It may be that we need a miracle to unite the forces.   I don’t think that we can continue should we lose Ben; mathematically we could, but for me this reflects an esthetic choice.  Throwing him the mantle of unAbbott was always a chance.  He caved in during the run-up, he is brilliantly analytical at times, he withdraws and gets all nerdy when he must.  At times none of us have been able to take necessary steps, if it is residual stuff from a life of being civil, or because we are a 'prototype' and have not the protocol to move into regions of horror, I cannot say.  I am used to having an overriding discipline that demands all forces pulling together.  If it means swallowing elements of ones individual understanding because not everyone thinks the same, one does so and contributes where one can.//"
