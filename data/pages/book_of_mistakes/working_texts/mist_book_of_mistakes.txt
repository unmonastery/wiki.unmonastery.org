====== Book of Mistakes  ======

|The idea to write the history of the unMonastery in the form of a book of mistakes was born at the 3rd Edgeryders gathering -in Matera. Not having placed in advance a system to evaluate the prototype, editing the Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions - as it was renamed,((This is oh so delicate territory.  This one is purely incorrect: **'The Book of Greater and Lesser Errors'** was the first title: The Book of Mistakes came soon after, but it was the vulgarisation.)) to direct the idea more towards the art of historical recording rather than complaining and blaming - became the sole tool to study the archives, not to retrieve a tale of glorious history, but as an attempt to capture the complex relationships between the ideas, the facts, the events, the group, the environment, the projects, and the 6 months timeframe. It attempts to define in retrospect **what in fact was** the unMonastery in Matera, as opposed to the virtual models, analyses and dreams produced before the prototype. |


**1.0 It is written somewhere that history may inform our current endeavours.** ((See Rachimburgs :
"Living libraries, they were law incarnate, unpredictable and terrifying."  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Germanic_law
))  
     
**2.0 "I wonder if the whole point of writing the book of mistakes is to discover the real mistakes." ((KH in an editorial chat meeting))**

History has indeed dictated that the lessons of the unMon be collected in a singular fashion. The title **Il Libro degli Errori** stuck: we are doomed to be judgmental upon our every action. It is a curse as much as a blessing.  Of course, it seems an unMistakable mistake. That several other wisdoms with less catchy titles are also interwoven into this visionary text is the cost of having a more passionate than precise PR department.  .

The Book of Mistakes is not a monotone list of our mortal foibles.  It is rather a dynamic exposure of our contradictions.  To parade our ‘negative moments lost’ as considered confession is to seek redemption;  the mosaic reflects upon itself.   In performing the task of compiling a satisfactory text, we have been witness to glorious collisions between its component parts.  Repeatedly, sparks of insight occur as conflicting units tug upon the same anecdote certain that it best illuminates their core themes.   

    
At the same time, labouring under the banner of that which still to this day is known as 'Book of Mistakes' is an unnecessary act of perpetual, petty penance.  This tabloid style title leads people to think of the unMonastery as a disaster, a failed dream, or even worse - a farce.  One of the *Greater or Lesser Omissions* is that inviting people to look solely through the filter of 'mistakes' we consistently fail to seize upon the wisdom in our work. The judgmental, tormented brain cannot allow the presence of positive and negative forces in one and the same moment.   As the story unfolds, it is clear that we in fact flirted with greatness and profundity.  We have something to learn from them Taoists.   

=== The unMo Strategies ===

"//My work scripting the Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions (aka Mistakes) is predominately fiction, in real life we may scarcely know what we are doing.  Golden, promising threads have been painfully dug forth, and then haphazardly dropped at the outer reaches of memory.  Sometimes the life-sustaining idea fountain nozzle doesn’t reach far enough.//" ((apparently the Scribe refers here to Il Rubinetto - Parables of the unMon.  [[http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/03/unmonastery-prototipo-matera/]]))

“Monasteries have a longer tradition than is immediately comfortable.  Historically they honour the outcast.  It times of need they represent a treasure of knowledge and continuity.  They exert strict discipline upon their contributors.  Inside their walls visitors may renew their most valuable connections with humanity.

"//To host an ER UnMonastery may be dangerous.  We will offer refuge to your questioning youth; we will seek to model a mode of life that demands more of our inner selves than the modern civilization outside our walls…//"
