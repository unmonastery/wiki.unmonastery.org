====== Sleeping arrangements ======


//"I am most concerned about focus and contemplation.  Ideally I would put monks in individual cells –  I doubt if our mandate involves learning to dig our own caves, but I think we need a compromise here.  In order to attract participants, and facilitate harmony, the sleeping situation needs to be less traumatising to people like me; four weeks camping out in a youth hostel would rapidly drain me of all energy.  Four months would be murder."//  ((BD to Antonio Elettrico, June 2013))


|Some technicalities caused by strangers living together in a new space fell into place by themselves. We spent nearly no time on sorting out the bathrooms. The strain of sleeplessness, on the other hand, turned out to be another matter. Organisation and reorganisation of the bedrooms happened several times, as general questions about personal habits were raised, and then dropped. Even with the best of intentions, without a serious reason, one does not like to be told when to go to bed and when to get up. |

Noise levels and various types of earplugs were tested. No solution presented itself other than acting responsibly and being open to try new formations.((The key invention was the establishment of the 'Light Sleepers' Room' which sought to protect chronic insomniacs from the unBallerinas.  However, a limit to this tidy division appeared when one of our more delicate souls also exhibited a light rolling snore.)) 

**2.0 Sleep deprivation has long factored in the mandatory ecstasy of monks and nuns...** ((While we recognise that certain (monastic) orders evolved the form of the solitary cell, we know that in many traditional societies operate with collective sleeping rooms.  Many of us have grown up sleeping alone in a single room for long periods of time.  To some this is beyond a luxury. A community of Indian social workers once expressed dismay at the Northern practice of giving children their individual room: //"What have they done wrong? what form of punishment can this be to make them sleep in isolation?"//  Traditionally, monasteries achieve a purity of purpose via some form of  sleep deprivation. (Poverty, Chastity, and Silence. - a report from LOTE#3 BD.) ))

Our //unVow of Poverty// has several unavoidable structural components.  The absence of personal space has shown that different people have different levels of adaptability.  Sleep deprivation has long factored in the mandatory ecstasy of monks and nuns.  Rising for ‘early morning’ prayers was a way to put the adaptive skills of both novice and initiate to trial.  //The Saga of the Snorers// is worth an illuminated manuscript by itself.  The total effect of the dormitory experience designed to resurrect fallen urbanites and to rewire any residue of a decadent lifestyle — seemed to work; although it has been noted that some centuries of similar experiments led the Benedictines to adopt the more satisfactory recipe of each monk to his individual cell.((//It seems that within the initial constellation of unMonasterians a collective sleeping arrangement successfully established itself in the Western sleeping hall. However, the rest of the anticipated floor plan has yet to be realised.  Not accustomed to fungal incursions, we have been left to mediating upon the expanding splotches of off-colour wall growth as if they were a fearful Shroud of Turin.  It has been implied that this is a harmless blessing of the Sassi, but that no information on either the high-tech (silica gel) or low-tech (vinegar) solutions employed by our neighbours was included in our guidebook has awoken creeping concern – when our core exercise of //‘Listening to the Stones’// becomes //'Breathing in the Lichen'//, the not yet acclimatised Northern Europeans may ask can this be healthy to share ones life with such mould?  Currently only one of our kind dares brave this environment, although perhaps this is a self-imposed penance spurred by serious snoring infractions...http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/  (It was later learned that the favoured technique for keeping such fungal growth in check was to position a mirror that could reflect sunlight into the offensive corner.)// ))


===UnMo the Mattress===


//“Show me a man’s bed and I ‘ll tell you who he is.”//
–  someone, once long ago

The prototype unMonastery bed is seemingly ingenious.  The European wooden palette specifics are clear: 80 X 120 cm.  Placed end to end, two of them are too long to be immediately useful; placed on the perpendicular they form an idea base for a standard 2m mattress with a convenient 40 x 80 cm head-end jetty as a side table for books, your mobile, the pile of travel receipts and a photo of Mamma.  Placed two high, roughly sanded and painted, they provide a right delightful alternative to flopping our unMo mattresses impulsively onto the floor and then spending the rest of ones stay stooping, squatting and otherwise performing involuntary yoga postures.  At this ideal height, your average feet can swing out of the horizontal and with the aid of a nifty 90 degree bend at the knee place themselves firmly on the cold stone floor.  Your day can begin.

The tricky bit is the 80 cm width.  Generous by historical standards (at least for a certain class of servant’s quarters), it provides a clear statement: "here lieth thou or else".  For those such as myself, spoiled by the wide open spaces of modernity, this otherwise welcome invention rapidly restructured my sleeping pattern.  Since a close woman friend once goaded me into expanding my territory, I have tended during the current stage in my life to spend more than the odd night alone swimming on a vast prairie of pressed fabric and springs.  A pattern has emerged.  I sleep most snuggly on my left side.  Head propped up by sufficient pillowage, I can then direct my limbs in an expressive sprawl that broadcasts unto no one my degree of inner satisfaction.

Alas, the unMo cot allows for none of this.  Flex one knee and it protrudes worryingly from off the precipice; retract it to terrra firma and the secure feeling behind ones back inevitably evaporates.  Like it or not, the dormitory bed flips most of us upon our backs; we only lack matron’s — //“Hands above the covers, Boys and Girls”// to complete the idyll.

Routinely rendered supine, the straight-jacketing effect can rapidly worsen as the trough within which we lay our weary bones gets compressed by the steadily progressive heights of our exhaustion.  Sleepless nights can be made of less.  For lo and behold, the imposition of the corpse pose doth cause the slack-jawed among us to split the airflow of our nightly inhalations, and since the vaulted roofs of our new home exhibit superior acoustic properties a gentle rolling snorer all too quickly acquires an unfavorable reputation.

The benefit of the well supported night’s sleep becomes apparent the next day.  The unMonasterians of Prototipo Matera have adopted an enviable discipline. Every morning as a brisk wind sweeps any vestiges of condensed moisture up the ravine to allow the sun’s first heat to grace our magnificent stone terrace that overlooks exactly that view you get in the tourist brochures, the unmoaning unMoners embrace their **Morning Practice**.  Internally it is described as a ‘morally mandatory optional’ gathering of the clan.  Morally mandatory option means what it says; if you lack the gumption to respond actively to the 0700 hours morning bell, you face the certain knowledge that the remaining crew has upped the silliness quota in the interplay of their core exercises with Greatest Hits from the Civil Arts Master’s trove of extra-appropriate behavior that are designed to irrefutably tweak the ensemble’s connection with their //inner goodness//…  ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/unmo-the-mattress/))

Among the scribblings attributed to the house scribe was yet another cryptic comment that can only be read as confession:  

 //The sounds of the street lift only me; the others will sleep firm until the morning bell - mine, internal, rang long ago with the refuse wagon, the early morning workers, the first cat to pad by our piazza.  Contemplation can be too much of a good thing; sleep would be better.   The bell-ringer has yet to catch me unSmiling in his direction as he pokes his head around the corner of the door.  It has become his game too: metal does not clang against metal until he has found my glance.  The others don’t even respond: raised in a noisier age without fear of leopards, their oblivion is not mine.  I will meet youthful resilience with chronic jealousy.  I will lampoon them with my grumpiness disguised as infinite patience.  They will see through me. //
