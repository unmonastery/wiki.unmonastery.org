===== Hospitality =====

|The unMonastery concept branched out of social cohesion research - can the young(ish), ambitious and talented be inspired to address age-old problems in forgotten parts of Europe? Can communities which have grown weary of social innovators and have a long history of intellectual colonialism lower their resistance and allow, or even fund, hackers, outcasts, artists and rebels to come and work on building a new world together?  In this unlikely affair, the universal tradition of hospitality offered itself as a tool: being hosted by a city, the newcomers open their doors and make their best effort to understand and be understood. unMonasteries have the potential to become regional hubs of global networks of experts, but only if they come up with a protocol to act as accepted connectors on both sides. Hosting international guests at the unMonastery while hosting events where their local allies can also meet them was to be crucial, although not always easy. Without becoming accepted, even tangentially, as trusted members of the local community this would never work.|

"As the song goes: we all need someone to emulate.  Life as a jewel encrusted icon shouldn't be sniffed at.  Entering the door of the unMon offers each person the same small first step on the road to beatification.  That few are to survive the journey is immaterial; ones initial steps are to be planted wisely.  Spiritual guidance is advised.

The psychological profile of those who enter the unMonastery is informative.  Taking upon oneself the role of the leading edge of an unSpiritual search without succumbing to self-righteousness is at best a horrendous balancing act.  Those assuming such positions of responsibility have traditionally been thoroughly vetted, but the //Edgeryders// have always boasted a flat structure: as a //‘do-ocracy’// ((Do-ocracy = Work designed by those who do the work.)), whoever boldly marches through the doors can seemingly claim the title of 'unMonasterian'.

Some didn’t get it.  Clumping around in noisey boots, [[book_of_mistakes:working_texts:mist_heresy|they led with their needs]] instead of their contributions. Service was denied. Blasphemies were uttered.  Candidacies for sainthood were quietly withdrawn...(("...unMoaners sublimate.  Our most significant strategy is the heaping upon one another of generous portions of incredibly sumptuous foods.  Twice a day seemingly haphazard pairings of the house’s inhabitants conspire to inspire.  Turning the glories garnered from local markets into our agency of appreciation and bombarding one another with the best we have on offer, we can get carried away.

Sometimes it goes wrong.  Bland pasta tastes like bland pasta — the lack of love resounds around the unMon eating hall.  Harmony does not reign.


Contemplation is a mixed blessing — thinking over certain phenomena gives inescapable conclusions.  Sumptuousness in its absence can expand beyond the merely insipid — it easily becomes an affront to virtue.  Incompetence, or an injudicious spice quota, reflects not a bad day in the kitchen but disdain for the collective.  To serve a flat sauce or even an over-ornate show-off of a salad is to kick the captive audience where it hurts.  Vows have been broken for less..."[[http://bembodavies.com/2014/07/28/the-currency-of-grace/]]))

How did //**‘the We’**// fail them?  ((the need for an articulated welcoming/initiation ceremony for novices and initiates was never properly addressed.   A list of prosaic information: practical stuff: kitchen, bedrooms etc. was written, but not kept up to date, and probably not circulated.)) 

=== The Opening Opening Circle ===
" The height of our spiritual exchange happened early on.  Perhaps considered an accident, it was never elevated to a model of desirable achievement.    At the culmination of our landing and lurching periods we set up our launch.  We chose to go big.  Not only would we present ourselves and our desired initiatives, we opened our house as a kind of ‘meet the community open-stage’ were local enterprises could present their activities for one another.  It was written up in the on-line draft edition of //‘Il Libro delgi Errori’// as a major success; its opening sentence setting the tone: **//“It is in the Nature of The Book of Mistakes that it is better written in Moments of Triumph.”//** ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/20/il-livro-dell-errori-ii/))

“The definitive highlight was our evening ritual — easing the lid upon the revelers, we summonsed the willing to one of our newly initiated cave rooms.  The speaking protocol of our Closing Circle was simply presented and the option to comment was proffered some thirty people.  Everyone took the opportunity to heart; eager voices waxed eloquently.  The community talked with each other through the medium of unMonasticism.” ((ibid))

Even without translation the eagerness in the room was palpable.  The unMonastery’s existence addressed a great hunger.  But as the entry mantra (“follow-up is everything”) ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/20/il-livro-dell-errori-ii/)) pointed out, our follow-through would have to be strategic.  It wasn’t."((To this day it is unclear what the forces are that so obliterated this experience from our collective memory.  Part of it was head office: from afar the unMoaners may have seemingly vanished off the face of the map; all our orientation towards gingerly expanding our rings of interaction among the people we were brought in ‘to serve’ was not providing a big enough bang for our international co-players.  Perhaps, miracles are subjective, and the several newcomers hadn’t fathomed the rarified quality of the air we were inhaling?  Nevertheless, we had barely swept up the last reveler, when we gathered to scupper the institutions that brought us so far.  Gone was our daily planning circle of orientation and our evening gathering of contemplation.  The proposal to live by a semi-lunar cycle of open community feasts along the model we had just triumphantly established was trashed in favour of a more showy simulcast weekly community evaluations with attendant open dinners.  **See Interface: Empty Gestures?**))
