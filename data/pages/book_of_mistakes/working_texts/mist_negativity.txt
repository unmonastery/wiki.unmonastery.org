====== Negativity ======

|unMonasteries were designed to take root in communities where to assume any kind of good faith was naive. A history of colonialism as well as fruitless attempts at economical development may have taken their toll long before our arrival. According to general opinion in Matera, unMonasterians were not to be trusted. Had we in fact done *anything*? - was a recurring question asked during our stay.|

"//That historic day in Strasbourg, brother Rysiek had been concerned that his organisations tended to go down in flames.  Negative energy accumulated and found no constructive outlet.  Groups lost their edge.  He postulated a lightning rod – a negativity grounder – a totem pole that acknowledged the delicate nature of ‘Working on the Edge’ and that would protect us from a bashing when times got intricate.//" ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/05/il-livro-dell-errori-iii/)) 

**1.0 Patience can be a limited commodity, talk of the unMonastery had circulated for weeks, but did we really do anything?    
    
2.0 In a quick series of slides, I flashed the forbidden 43 Challenges in all their glory, highlighting the fact that each of them was based around a perceivable element of negativity: ( 21 examples of the word “No”, supplemented by 5  “Nots”)** (( The Negativity Chorus in all its glory is included in this attempt to record a moment of triumph : http://bembodavies.com/2014/04/05/il-livro-dell-errori-iii/)) .    
     
**3.0 Our version of the unHolier than thou, while it must seek this rapture, cannot afford to take shortcuts.** ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))  
    

//"The first fundamental challenge of the unMonastery project in Matera has been to establish itself operationally in the building - the first month of the project was essentially written off due to dealing with infrastructural roadblocks, a combination of no heating, no internet and so forth prevented the project starting upon arrival of the first unMonasterians." ((That temporary snowblindness could so invoke such a loss of perspective is a source of acute embarrassment: it was clearly stated in at least several places that sweeping up dust and the rigging of pipes were the loving labours of the first unMon year.  About this time some more alert soul hatched the 'No Complaining' as the only clause in the unMon rule book. Link ))   
    
Our early duties at the unMo had to do with other survival skills.  Shivering was a universal that didn’t require an interpreter.  Eating was largely preverbal; recurring spells of ‘excommunication’ (unMo-speak for prolonged internet disconnectivity) left us virtually speechless.  If civilized conversation was indeed indulged in, it was largely saved for cursing the Gods.  When we finally opened our mouths it was to invoke a ‘No Complaining’ clause that forced us to shut them again. ((http://bembodavies.com/unmonastery-1-0/))
