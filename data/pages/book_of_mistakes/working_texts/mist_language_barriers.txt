== 1.0 We needed to flag our helplessness. ==


**"A second factor in our newly acquired poverty involved abandoning all our 'wordly possessions'.  For many of us this has included our greatest treasure – our ability to communicate.**  Embracing ‘virulent linguistic helplessness’ has been an additional challenge for th(os)e far afield.  Not all of the unMonks have previously digested the experience of second language acquisition in their adult condition.  Facing the surrender of a hard fought for functional //lingua franca// only to begin again at the primitive phrase book phase can also easily provoke an allergic reaction.  An additional cost of this chronic infantile condition was too much reliance on bilingual local speakers as functional interface.  This inevitably stretched this resource too finely."(("//Many hidden "staff" duties emerged once arriving, which required management by someone with Italian as their mother tongue. Being the only resident one, I took care of them: welcoming and presenting the projects, translation online/in presentations/in meeting, managing workers to finish the renovation of the building, acquiring food and more. In the remaining time, I worked (less than I wanted) on the internal dynamics of the unMonastery as a group and informally in creating and fostering relations outside. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to organize a process to continuously listen to the burning questions of the community (like "Can Matera really benefit from the candidacy?") and creating space to host those conversations."// **--How the Project has changed - extract from First Report to Stakeholders, Cristiano Siri**))


"//Conventional and unconventional attempts to speed the acquisition of Italian have been integrated into our daily liturgy, but again we are squeezed by the condensed time factor.  **It is bad pedagogy to jump into premature language use before one is acquainted with the basics.**  In the three year model : year two and then year three would involve considerably more cross-fertilisation.  The frustration level is currently being addressed to the degree that individuals have the imaginative resources, but it is only time that will relieve the more acute symptoms.//"((http://bembodavies.com/2014/03/06/the-health-of-the-idea-fountain/))


"//We wouldn't have had some of the expressions of ingrained helplessness had each individual managed to set themselves the task to expand their base of Italian by two all-purpose phrases a day...//" 


|In the selection of unMonasterians, language skills were not given particular attention. Since the raison d'être of our existence was the city's running a bid for CCE 2019, we had to be diverse in skills and nationality, gender balanced, with a strong emphasis on technological skills and a track record of delivering projects. In the first months, there was just one native speaker of Italian in the house, who was overwhelmed by the task of managing building work, sorting out food acquisition, and communicating our needs to different service providers. Our "oblates", associate unMonasterians who had family and a job in Matera and therefore did not live with us, were unable to do their projects because their time was spent on assisting everyone else. The fluctuating anxiety about delivering our projects and building and guarding the unMonastery principles and habits removed from the agenda the need to start learning the basics of the language upon arrival.|

* The original wording of this page was suspect.  Penned by a uniphone, 'barriers' reconstructed a familiar perception of mutual intelligibility as trench warfare.  A less unCompromising stance allows that the linguistic interface provides much common ground.  Barriers separate; gaps are to be **bridged**. //"Il nostro duro lavoro"// should have been audible before it was visible. An attempt to be both was incorporated into the highly visible (to early morning passersby in the outreaches of the Sassi) morning practice. According to extant contemporary notes this was meant to expand to two hours linguistic training; instead it shrank. It must be considered excessively feeble for an organ of community activists that publicly acknowledged the vital role of its interface to fail to scientifically develop a miraculous level of linguistic adroitness as our primary agent of social interaction. 


Composing and learning a key personal introductory paragraph of some 6-7 sentences that located each of us foreigners in a similar plight was proposed at the end of week two.  That the time to allocate energy to such a vital tool never manifested itself may have been due to a slip of the pin:  on our board of initiatives - //Stimulating Linguistic Diversity// was skewered to our in-house projects.  **As such, learning the basics was treated as personal development. This was deeply erroneous -- it should have been elevated to a central component in our interface design with designated daily practice sessions.**  We needed to flag our helplessness." (("//Brother Elf never learnt that much Italiano.  Early on he expressed his unWillingness.  We failed him.  His rationale when proposing largely reciprocal 'Broken English' as his only viable communication platform was short-sighted.  In one way he was utterly correct and he had a better case than the unilingual among us; he had no internal need to learn to become an eloquent Italian speaker.  What he did need however, was to master just enough atrocious Italian to create a mutual meeting place - a willingness to move out into vast fields of linguistic helplessness, where as if by magic 95% of his collaborators would, if only to put him out of his misery, gladly wade out with their own suddenly mysteriously less hopeless English.//" The unMoaners had to go first.))
   


====Psycho-linguistic strategies====

Bilingualism isn’t easy.  Once one has acquired a certain grace, and in a forgiving climate, it may only periodically provoke symptoms of schizophrenia.  However, there exists an enormous grey zone between acquiring a few meager all-purpose defensive phrases, and the death-defying leap required to successfully employ them.

People vary.  Having once survived one linguistic transplant may provide one sufficient faith with which to successfully negotiate the process a third or fourth time; still it is also possible to harbour the opposite allergic reaction of //‘never again’//.  Those whose personal history has never forced them into the position of a linguistic minority may find it particularly naked to embrace the pleasure of speaking a second language.

UnMonasterians are dependent upon nuanced, intricate communication with their host communities.  Some things can go through the filter of translators, some cracks can be circumvented via significant ritual.  Goodwill goes a long way.   **However, to augment our capacity to have an effective presence in the field, every technique to build our linguistic proficiency should be incorporated into our daily practice.**

The Materan flagship prototype was quickly confronted exactly this dilemma; a mixture of uniphones, polyglots, native speakers and the chronically stubborn stood perched on the outer rim of effective public education with a thankless task.  In our practical reality, the mental gymnastics to absorb and actify Italian had to occur as we hit the beach.  The truncated projected presence for a mere four months was inhuman at best.  Lacking the resources of the KGB to bombard the unMonks with the hyper-learning techniques employing hypnosis, sleep deprivation, somatic feedback mechanisms and God knows what else, we (and our language acquisition) were more or less up to our own initiative…

The latest contribution to language learning is the free net-based services set up by benevolence entities such as the EU.  A few hardy souls ventured out into the wilds of **Duolingo** to expose themselves to a scattering of rudimentary elements.  It is useful enough to increase familiarity with basics, but even when amplified by its in-built system of compete with your friends, it hardly provides a hands-on deep learning experience. ((The stages of language acquisition and activation can be effectively sped up and stimulated, but you cannot skip an early, vital step.  As an adult one knows what language is; how it carries thought patterns from one person to another using agreements of meaning.  This forms an impediment, we cannot approach second (third, fourth) language learning as it did the first time we learnt a language. We cannot just jump in and make the sounds of our target language in hope that meaning will soon distill itself.  To effectively gain any satisfactory grasp of this target language we have to remove and neutralise the influence of our mother tongue.  Otherwise, we risk running some kind of absurd translation program that replicates word for word in a largely non-functional syntax.

 The primary antidote to this kind of literal translation is to first absorb full phrases in a genuine social context.  This absorption phase requires an immersion in the sounds and listening to quantities of social dialogue.  Most educational programs reduce the complexity of this dialogue to something so mundane that it no longer fulfills the requirement of a genuine social context.  It is dead sound supplied by dislocated voices perched in some sterile recording studio.    **Listening in the field provides both more of a challenge and more rewards.  It might be slower, but integration it offers is undoubtably deeper.**  The added step in this non-short cut scenario is word recognition.  Instead of being offered empty phrases on a plate, one has to locate and isolate them oneself.  Slowly individual words isolate themselves as sounds even if one cannot yet retain their significance.  Frequency is noted, patterns are noted, target concepts capture the imagination.  At some point one imagines that one can comprehend subject matter, cross references occur, we evolve an approximate understanding.    At the same time we activate our personal basics, slowly collecting the raw material desirable should we wish to break the sound barrier.  It is here we can begin to jump.  Given motivated circumstances we can create neurological imperative to feed our social exchange with our accumulated (though limited) resources. ))

=====Il Credo =====   

**A Mouthful**   

To prime the transition to an active bilingual lifestyle, a subtle Italiano component was inserted into the finale of our early morning physical practice.  After loosening limb and fantasy in the most dramatic of circumstances on the unMonastery’s impressive walled terrace that jutted out over the rim of Matera’s fabled ravine, a core text of semi-practical phrases was introduced.  **The non-Credo of the non-Monastery** was pure indoctrination.  Used to both break our sound barrier, and to broadcast our ideological fundamentals, it stretched our ears and tongues over the rack of our individual helplessness.   According to plan: the unMonks, force fed foreign sounds and poetry, would soon become hungry for more.  In practice it was just plain torture…


**Il non-Credo delle non-Monache:**   
//"Ancor non lo sappiamo,   
nel frattempo lasciateci perdere.   
Affronta i tuoi errori faccia a faccia:   
I sacri muri preserveranno a nostra onestà.    
Il nostro duro lavoro sará tanto leggendario quanto i nostri baccanali.     
Ci domandiamo di cosa i giusti godranno a cena ?"//
    
 
//“At the moment we cannot comprehend, 
so in the meantime we shall: ‘Get Lost’.    
Confront your mistakes, face to face -    
the Sacred Walls shall preserve our integrity.    
Our hard work shall be as legendary as our Bacchanalia.    
We wonder what the good people shall enjoy for dinner… ?”//
(my rough translation)   
    
Having ‘mastered’ the above liturgical programming, we shared it with the assembled multitudes attending our inaugural press conference who gleefully chanted along with us. (The good old-school leftist mayor let out a delightful audible grunt of recognition as he crested the hill for the finishing line.)    
   
We did do the sleep deprivation…"


==== Raw Materia ====
We let some golden opportunities go.  Maria Byck had a prolific productivity, in her 5 month unMonastery stay she collected some 70 video portraits.  As art objects they weren’t perhaps any more virtuoso than the daily production of snapshots from the Cathedral lookout.  That wasn’t their point, their attraction lay partially in their naivety - unEdited and unInterpreted they offered us an ideal feedback loop, posted on Facebook they still got a respectable amount of viewings by friends and family.  However, as research they languished. Maria herself never knew what was being said; a parade of recruits sat by her side for an hour or two to translate, but the sheer volume of material was daunting.  **The region’s spokespeople were far from dumb; we however were deaf.** 

Where we failed both Maria and her subjects is that we failed to bring them into our circles.  These open-hearted revelations of individual concerns were ideal after breakfast morning circle material -  sitting together they should have been transcribed and de-coded; key phrases should have been put to memory - our neophyte linguistic prowess would have thus been placed on the fast-track following the contours of the concerns of our host community.
