====== Expectations ======

**The Prototypes** 
Every installation of the unMonastery will be unique. There is not a fixed recipe - local resources form the raw materials while the gathering of inhabitants may provide some unfamiliar health promoting herbs and spices as teachers, ceremony leaders and behind the scenes facilitators.

**What we require from Local Community**

  * clear resources
  * commitment
  * active agents - bridge people
  * understanding of growth phases
  * patience

**What they should expect from us**:

  * moral, ethical, ecologically benign model of life
  * accessible insight in working methods and strategies in a framework that demands self-sacrifice and discipline ((It is also the case that traditional monasteries don't operate as a community of novices, the unMonastery requires a rapid learning curve. Monks don't just put on the uniform; novices are subject to trials and initiations within a hierarchy of experience. People who come to work at the unMon may or may not be refugees from civilisation. They are have made an idealistic choice to carry their skills to a responsive climate. This may require some negotiation.))
