====== Thinking Strategically ======

==== A Library of Experience ====
For the first 20 years each unMonastery must be considered a bold experiment.  Only with time can we become an established, traditional life form.  This manual and its expanded version the Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions is a tool to help evolve successful and healthy roots.

===== Local PR =====
Modern society hasn't the patience for long-term projects; the fun is supposed to begin immediately. Recognising this, part of our task is to work with our local agents to demonstrate visible value. With our genesis in Social Cohesion Research, our key mission is renew core skills of democracy.  One arm of our long term work is to distill best practice in community dialog.

**Time Frame**
unMonastery can be viewed in different time perspectives.  Short term they might be exotic zoos offering nomadic workshops.  Once established they embark upon moderately longer collaborative community projects that transfer skills and galvanise local initiatives.  With time and flexibility they have the a potential to respond to the demands that (rapid) change will force upon them.
