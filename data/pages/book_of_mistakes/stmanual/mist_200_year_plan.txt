====== 200 Year Plan ======


The unMonastery is not science fiction. It is a concrete investment in the long-term future: a race to build a network of interlocking communities that hope to preserve the keys to human social resilience. 
The contract on offer is simple: the host communities provide the primary resource of the building, we staff it with the best candidates we can find.  Over the coming years the each unMonastery seeks to establish itself as a strategically valuable human resource as the unMonastery and its community become intertwined.

**Our Tools**
The unMonastery is not a solo effort.  History provides a viable model: monasteries grow over generations, they are sponsored by the powers that be to deliver key services with a spiritual component.  Typically a constellation of unMonasterians contains different disciplines and approaches. The unMonasterians may partake in society at large, but they are not necessarily of it; their foreignness and access to international knowledge net is one of their advantages, but their moment of proof is relevant service.  Their major work projects are to be devised //i situ // in collaboration with local forces. 

**The Prototypes**
Every installation of the unMonastery will be unique.  there is not a fixed recipe - local resources form the raw materials while the gathering of inhabitants may provide some unfamiliar health promoting herbs and spices as teachers, ceremony leaders and behind the scenes facilitators. 
 
 

**What we require from Local Community**
  * clear resources
  * commitment
  * active agents - bridge people
  * understanding of growth phases
  * patience

**What they should expect from us**:
  * moral, ethical, ecologically benign model of life
  * accessible insight in working methods and strategies in a framework that demands self-sacrifice and discipline ((It is also the case that traditional monasteries don't operate as a community of novices, the unMonastery requires a rapid learning curve.  Monks don't just put on the uniform; novices are subject to trials and initiations within a hierarchy of experience. People who come to work at the unMon may or may not be refugees from civilisation.  They are have made an idealistic choice to carry their skills to a responsive climate. This may require some negotiation. ))
