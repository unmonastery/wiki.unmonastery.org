**The Book of Greater and Lesser Failures.**
A key tool in the spread of the unMo idea was a capacity to admit our fears and vulnerabilities.  Not all unMo work progressed smoothly.  More than anything else the erection of ‘Strasbourg Totems’ as a central ritual element of evaluation provided the unMonasterians with a tactile manner to recycle their inevitable frustrations.  Meeting regularly round the magnetic negative Pole to balance their aims and strategies and process any unPleasantness.  That they would then quickly re-form around the triumphant positive pole to dance their simple truths of humanness, allowed them to keep.







**It is written:**
The early unMo communities became expert at the culture of change and in harnessing the collective wisdoms of groups with an uncanny capacity absorb positive organic small scale inventions that recycled much energy into their community service.

Their work was clearly  value based – not solely determined by the tasks at hand, but through an articulate shared vision that remained flexible and syncronised even when working in a decentralised, work distributed pattern.  

So skilled at transforming conflict to creative friction did we become that major organisations such as the International Union of Black Sheep and the Disgruntled Young Peoples’ Alliance ( formerly unEmployed Youth of the Earth) quickly found their way to the unMo.  The total package lifestyle solution that supplied a meaningful life of dedicated service and camaraderie, rapidly became so essential to many people’s existence that the unMo practice became the cultural norm.

It has been established by the glorious Rita
[[http://edgeryders.eu/comment/5834#comment-5834]]and seconded by the glorious Jessica that the unMo kitchen must be the **Goddess of our Existence**.  Around this primal field of interaction, we shall channel our mutual nourishment and develop our culture.  While it is not necessary that all supplicants to the unMo document their qualification as a gourmet chef; it shall be a shame if they are not so when/if they choose to leave…

The one mandatory qualification for a life as unMonk/ unNun is that we are humans.  Humans forget; denial is our speciality.  One task of the unMonastery is to become a library of experience: to remind one another.  Removed from the coddling of modern convenience, we shall live a life that confronts our civilizedness.  It is our capacity to surmount this confrontation that is the true fruit of our labours.


===**The Rigours of the unMonastery**===
Life in the unMonastery offers a cross between an artistic residency and a spiritual retreat.  Our progression towards one-size-fits-all //praecepta vitalia// (vital precepts) has not yet reached its conclusion; the collective journey towards this wisdom shall in itself become a source of valuable knowledge. While the constraints of establishing our Matera prototype require that these precepts evolve at an inorganic pace, drawing copiously upon both historical monastic practice and the traditions of squatters, can initially inform our life rhythms and decision making processes.

In choice of diet, interactive patterns and work load, we shall perhaps approach the model of self-development disciplines.  Only our development is of the collective self.  Aspects of our individual programming shall inevitably be dropped at the door.  Work is to be done.

Beyond designing a re-fit for urban geeks who haven’t yet succumbed to their gluten intolerance, the unMonastery is a service organ.  We shall survive by creating inviting rhythms and rituals that allow us to embrace a life of devotion in the face of a crumbling game.  Our medium must be internal human warmth. We seek to build a regime of personal acceptance and confrontation with a generous proportion of collective triumph augmented by sensual feedback.  Through communion with our deepest nature – the dance, and most excellent food shall be our currency of conversion.  Our vow of silence may become a periodic vow of non-verbalism.


**Sleeping regime:**
While we recognise that certain orders evolved the form of the solitary cell, we know that in many traditional societies operate with collective sleeping rooms.  Many of us have grown up sleeping alone in a single room for long periods of time.  To some this is beyond a luxury. A community of Indian social workers once expressed dismay at the Northern practice of giving children their individual room: What have they done wrong? what form of punishment can this be?  Traditionally monasteries achieve a purity of purpose via some form of  sleep deprivation.

**Dietary regime**
Restricted as we are to a diet of ultra healthy regional produce, malnutrition cannot be seen as an immediate problem.  However, many novices and supplicants have reported to not own their own bloodstream.  A transitional, rigorous cleansing period of up to two weeks is proposed.  This seems a particular adjustment for those from colder climes who may need to adjust both their sleeping patterns and digestive tracts.
 After the exposure to some 40 or so concerned, active voices, who sacrificed the first Saturday of spring to be put through the paces by Ben and the formidable Gaia via what can sometimes become a rather flimsy mapping procedure, it is clear that a sufficiently diverse group of people are primed, hungry and engaged in making our presence a vital catalyst.  The imported Edgeryders will not be fighting for attention, we will be quickly coming in contact with a vibrant group of people eager to run with whatever relevant stimulus they may derive from our presence.  Much could indeed be managed without us.


**Detox Period**
It is written: People arrived at the gates with their habits intact.  Addictions to caffeine, nicotine and the bonhomie of pub life as not shed in a day.  Some people regularly checked their e-mail and/or absorbed the flesh of our fellow creatures.  If desirable, these things could change.

Sharing a chemical reality with a small circle of people is just that.  The intake of one affects the others.  Any statement of an ideal impinges upon traditional freedoms.  Blood is thicker than prototype.

It is written that we have not rules but aesthetics - what is appropriate behaviour is a subjective interpretation of a universal standard.
