===Piccolo Popolo di Piazza===
Two days later came the second public manifestation of our move to Piccianello: a children’s workshop in  — Occupying Public Space –.  Once again we were fortunate that the compact nature of Materan society delivered just the right people into the very middle of our plans.

We might have had trouble; the date and time selected was meant to capture the children emptying out of the adjacent Scuola Marconi.  Nobody among our crew seemed to have noticed the fact that that Monday was an extra late spring day-off to facilitate the European election process.  Nevertheless we showed up, dodged a brief rain shower, and held an event for 20 or so youngsters using that most effective medium of 25 kgs of clay.  Over two hours the Occupiers took over the flowerbeds, benches and fountains.  Big thanks to Rosa diPede and Lydia.  (see separate report)
