====== On Chasity, Vow of ======

 It was written: many moons before the first unMonasterians entered the gates...


===== ‘zipper problems‘   -  Vow of Transformance =====

At this point there is no available unCulting insurance:  internally there is a belief that we have avoided any pressure to form unhealthy, parasitical hierarchies.  No one seems to be lurking on the horizon harbouring illusions of insatiable entitlement.  However, those at the flexi-core of the collective efforts might be the last to recognise their own aberrations. 

**The unMonastery cannot sidestep a stance on the historic choice to repress sexuality.**   Disruptions to the Vow of Chasity have fractured many an ecclesiastical order.  Choosing, if we do, to uphold some kind of unVow of unChasity may easily prove equally disruptive.  It is essential that we evolve a Vow of unRepression that recognises, celebrates and somehow transforms our inevitable sexual life-force in the service of the community.  No one is being asked to leave their hormones behind - the question becomes what discipline are they to be subject to:  -- //Can erotic tension and/or the suppression of it serve and strengthen the collective in any way?//  --- Help !  who in their right mind wants to enter the minefield of proposing the channeling erotic energy to private and collective components?

 It is always possible to let things merely evolve around the individuals concerned.  In at least 30% of the examples studied some kind of palatable compromise has been ironed out.  There is little in human history that suggests that this humanist laissez faire tradition, is wise.  Should we chose to avoid the unThinking?

The proposed discipline is one of //no internal unions// -- should this repel those who inevitably find themselves in a mutual worship configuration, we must become adroit at celebrating these inevitable potentials with festivals of projection/ denial/ heartbreak.   Should exclusive unions occur, they are encouraged to form an outer unMo ring to recycling the energy and the promise by becoming leaders of the vespers (evening dance sessions).
 
At the same time it is unlikely that we can creatively release absolutely everyones personal histories of trauma.  To the best of the assembled unMonastarians capacity, those suffering shall be granted ‘time’.  Meditation, long walks and periods of silence shall be complimented by periods of respectful listening.  Skills from far and wide are to be mobilised to return the unNun into a disciplined life of service.  Growth strategies are many.

((While many pointed out that human sexuality is a source of great joy and renewal, this brave accommodation to an anticipated problem has not been researched.   Either the proto-unMoaners were a singularly chaste bunch or so exceptionally discrete that this quandary failed to manifest itself.  The one occurrence a technical breech of this guideline when an established pair briefly attached to the workspace imported elements of marital discord with a most unpleasant effect on the working climate.  This seemed to indicate that we were on the right track.))


====== Interface ======

Errori #1 is that we failed to unPack this term sufficiently.  As the middle of three conceived catagories of the unMonastery effort, it wallowed between the clearer extremes of in-house (upon occasion given as internal) and outreach.  If in-house is what we are, and out reach is what we do,  interface is who we are.  (See Progettini)  (Damiano’s chart of the office space)

At some point priorities were drawn up.  The operation was operational, it was time to turn outward.  We needed to meet the people, we needed a website ?  Alas, for shame, we got stuck here.  For some a website was a thing of professional pride - the criteria that issued demands established that it should be state of the art, entirely open source, functional and servicable.  Still after 5 months in the field we have nothing more enticing than a faceBook account.  The EdgeRyders precedence that had served our needs in the build-up phase, was never configured to serve the needs of our primary first time visitor.  It was pointed out at several junctures, and perhaps undiplomatically, that there exist fully functional shareware platforms that would have provided for our basic webpage needs after perhaps three days of fiddling.

** Evaluation**
The exploration of the unMon cannot be objectively measured from inside itself.  It would be imperceivable had we reached the 3% mark.  Things have occurred, people have come and gone and returned again.  Individual participants get welcomed warmly in the streets.  There are precious few constants.     


===== The Code   - an appendix to the B of M ? =====


We cannot have unRule for quite obvious reasons; things would rapidly become unRuly.  For slightly less obvious reasons it is also difficult to have Rule.  The emotional modus of living in the unMonastery is somewhat more complex than humbly subjecting oneself to wiser ways.  For the modern human to willingly undercast themselves a hierarchy is generally considered a symptom of personality disorder.   The last 200 years of European history have declared that we are all ‘individuals’ with equal rights to determine our place on this glorious earth.  We no longer do:  tribe, clan, social strata, our humble station or even family.

According to some readings of the traditional monastic movement, the monastic gates took aboard political refugees and societal outcasts for refurbishing -- no questions asked ?   This seems highly unlikely.  More plausibly, the questions were few, simple, direct and uncompromising: Are you willing to unFlinchingly follow the ways of the brotherhood?  It is easy to imagine that the answer was a silent nod of an already lowered head - this accompanied by the clatter of surrendering all ones personal belongings.

As Francesco of Imaginateca asked as he wrestled with accepting his membership into the first unMonastery cull: //What kind of people can so drop their life as to enroll themselves in an undefined community of unknowns? //  Internally, we debated this ‘brave experiment’ as strategic unemployment.  Externally, what is being said is routinely blithely ignored by the core practitioners.


There will always be a social pedagogical component to our unMonastery work -- since we don’t actually have several centuries of practice to point the way, if we are even to approach becoming a ‘We’, we needs must actively retrain ourselves as unMonastery material.   Our structural adjustment devices weren’t many: sleeping in dormitories and celebrating collective mealtimes could round off some of our edges.  Initially, we spent considerable time in meetings learning to locate one another on the map.  Planing in concert seemed a conscious way of building a unity of purpose.  Not everything was attended to.

The need to polish each other up became so evident that it was easily avoided. We weren’t here to systematically build an ideal society, we would rather adapt to one another as strictly necessary.  Demands that suggested how we should interact were not to be decreed from above, but to be absorbed from our experience.  That we predicated the merit of our work to be measurable by our service component was meant to forestall naval gazing; impulses to indulge in collective introspection were from time to time shot down.  Our capacity to cherish one another was stimulated by our various degrees of beautifulness, but lacking a social mandate code to pursue such things, we couldn’t process this into realms of ecstasy.




Living in a labyrinth it is tempting to set up camp in the relative comfort of a known cul-de-sac.  The way forward invites even more heart-wrenchingly false steps.  Inertia is safety. (an orphan from ? more somewhere -- not black book)

** LOTE Mainstream**
The element of consciously cultivating ‘We code’ was too dangerous and too subject to sabotage.  One voice could scupper any proposal.  Because everything in a prototype is a proposal, long term survival of an idea wasn’t an immediate issue, everything was equally expendable.  As long as we were reasonably convinced that we were 'Living on the Edge' we could be content as laboratory rats.  .

Proposals could be aired in the periphery, but no one could possibly take them as binding in a democracy.  As Jeff Bez  disrobed democracy during his initial visit, the concept is seeped in a tradition where a steering organ of the elite dictate the order for the masses.  This clearly wasn’t in our repertoire; rules from above would need to apparently start from scratch and retain their flexibility.
The legacy of linguistic imperialism and conflicting standards of attention to detail provided the other legs of our wobbly construction.  


Intuiting order
the push to be normal - do not compromise comfort zones- unwillingness to move into extreme stances of discipline, culture of the unMo - habits breaking habits


Detox Period
It is written: People arrived at the gates with their habits intact.  Addictions to caffeine, nicotine and the bonhomie of pub life as not shed in a day.  Some people regularly checked their e-mail and/or absorbed the flesh of our fellow creatures.  If desirable these things could change.

Sharing a chemical reality with a small circle of people is just that; the intake of one effects the others.  Any statement of an ideal impinges upon traditional freedoms.  Blood is thicker than prototype.

It is written that we have not rules but aesthetics - what is appropriate behaviour is a subjective interpretation of a universal standard


Il Libro degli Errori It is written somewhere that history may inform our current endeavors.  History has indeed dictated that the lessons of the unMon be collected in a singular fashion.  The title Il Libro degli Errori stuck: we are doomed to be judgmental upon our every action.  It is a curse as much as a blessing; of course, it seems an unMistakable mistake.   That several other wisdoms with less catchy titles are also interwoven into this visionary text is the cost of having a more passionate than precise PR department.  .




WorkStorming

 
Brother Elf never learnt that much Italiano.  Early on he expressed his unWillingness.  We failed him.  The rationale when he was proposing largely reciprocal Broken English as his only viable communication platform was short-sighted.  In one way he was utterly correct and had a better case for militantly sticking to his accomplishments than did the unilingual among us; he had no internal need to learn to become an eloquent Italian speaker.  What he did need however, was to master just enough atrocious Italian to create a mutual meeting place - a willingness to move out into vast fields of linguistic helplessness, where as if by magic 95% of his collaborators would, if only to put him out of his misery, gladly wade out with their own suddenly mysteriously less hopeless English.   The unMoaners had to go first.

Composing and learning a key personal introductory paragraph of some 6-7 sentences that located each of us foreigners in a similar plight was proposed at the end of week two.  That the time to allocate energy to such a vital tool never manifested itself may have been due to a slip of the pin:  on our board of initiatives - Stimulating Linguistic Diversity was skewered to our in-house projects.  As such, learning the basics was treated as personal development. **This was deeply erroneous -- it should have been elevated to a central component in our interface design with designated daily practice sessions.  We needed to flag our helplessness.**

==== State of the Art Report on my Theatre Research ====
  
 A desire appeared after several months questioning the local population to trace the history of community theatre in the city.  I wished to stage a community evaluation meeting on the history of //Theatro della Sassi//.  Unfortunately, when I made inquiries, it seemed that this endeavor had met an ignoble end, and that the all too familiar bitter schism ruptured this valuable organ.  The resultant law suits and spiritual divorces were still too ripe to allow the protagonists to share the same room.  This occurring in such a small community magnifies the tragedy.  It felt beyond my mission and resources to facilitate reconciliation; I chose to ‘let sleeping dogs lie’.  

The role of “Art” in the house fell rapidly far down the hierarchy of needs.  Warmth, food and healthy air took precedence over self-expression; so did getting a stable 24 hour internet connection, and an all-things-to-all-people website up and running.  My contribution fell to the sneak attacks of guerilla warfare: a bad joke here, holding short speeches at our more formal dinners, rewriting the occasional wad of text.  

I arose earlier than most to lead a 0745 awakening session discretely dubbed //‘morning practice’//.  This continued in one form or another for two months before I, heartbroken by the lack of discipline displayed by the younger generation, could no longer find the motivation.    At is best it was highly magical.  In twenty short minutes, the stiff and grumpy among us would emerge from our exploration of our collective creativity invigorated and viscerally convinced that they were involved in a beautiful experiment.   Even without specifically articulating its deeper objectives, the morning mix of intersecting exercises did it’s work of welcoming the entire individual for an energy booster that magnified **The We**.

  Into this morning session, I dropped one ideological contribution.  A short text, written shortly before I descended was translated into somewhat ponderous Italiano.  It addressed several needs: beyond breaking the sound barrier from week one, the text addressed the issues facing us and the working principles that would keep us strong.  It was used religiously as a vibrant liturgy to push the energy generated under morning practice into our awareness of our mission and the linguistic challenge before us.  For those who took the trouble to learn it by heart, it offered valuable solace in times of doubt.    

This our Credo found several other applications: appearing as a mass chant at our first press conference that had the city mayor chuckling under his breath, getting written up as an impressive wall hanging for our open house ceremonies, being drawn out for recital at various dinner parties.  However, lacking any sanctioning power, this illuminating text fell into disuse as newcomers felt little curiosity as to its content, and the veterans proved insufficiently poised to convey its significance.  Last sighted, the written artifact had been shoved into a corner during some clean up process - no one appeared to take affront.  

The role of the Dance was given a similarly marginal role.  The need for dance was foreseen  as a necessary source of renewal; a solid sound system had appeared on the list of ‘on-site necessities’.  However it took several weeks for it to arrive and to break the ice.  A moment or two of bopping by a couple of veterans and demonstrations of the joys of early morning contact improvisation were not enough for dance to be considered part of house culture.  By the time our naturally cavernous dance floor was well heated enough to safely enter, we had forgotten what we might have had to rejoice over.  

Several months later the waves of psychic refurbishment gave signs that the treasure of the dance floor might indeed establish itself.   My personal training as a performer were called upon from time to time.  It fell to me to script the prosaic parable of our existence as the Nozzle of the unMon Idea at our opening press conference.  This was adapted on demand for the open house party were I also performed a roof raising participatory ritual that revealed the depth of co-conspiracy that had brought us all together.  While in the hierarchy of art it is considered a step downwards to go from dispensing wisdom to appealing to raw emotion, it could get worse.  It soon did...



**Empty Gestures ?**
Another ‘artistic’ contribution to the house structure was to propose a cycle of bi-weekly parties with which to encapsulate our interface with our surrounds in something culturally coherent and hopefully contagious.  These started out well.  Party #1 at day 12 was a warm and heartfelt affair.  Party #2 was more decentralised as unMoaners dispersed throughout Basilicata in search of the true carnival.  Our third party (discussed elsewhere) was a vibrant triumph -- not only did it fulfill our needs to exercise our potential interface, it illuminated the weaknesses in our operation.  In the aftermath of this event things took a dive.  

**  Virtual Parties **
Instead of concentrating on our strengths as a cultural facility, a perceived superficial weakness of low international visibility was given disproportionate attention.  The bi-weekly party slot was usurped in favour of a weekly ‘community review’ to be sweetened by an Open Dinner.  This combo was eagerly embraced by a segment of our in-house population; the community review bit to be held as simulcast testimonials over the work we were doing (or at least polished up as YouTube fodder.)  The first round were clever, polite, and excessively boring.  They were bad theatre.  Attending the first evening I was provoked by the paucity of emotional meat being offered a largely non-comprehending audience of 5-6 people.  The performer in me jumped into this vacuum and improvised an impromptu work demonstration that, insensitively labelled by an uncomprehending co-worker, rapidly became a cause celebré.   (insert links to mocking webpage and response here)

Thankfully, the next party in the two-week cycle was also a reported triumph - Open Tech School’s birthday party for the Arduino Board attracted an active, inquisitive crowd in such proportions that calling it a crowd is not mere rhetoric.  However the susequent week’s community review / open dinner soon revealed the bankruptcy of its guiding principle -- minted for our international supporters the community review had nothing to offer the local community.  The third party in this series may have appeared on three or four laptops around the globe, but it hosted a grand total of zero analogue guests...  

This was not the utter end of the Davies contribution to our interface work.  The behind the scenes dramaturgy supporting Piccianello Night was fabulous.  Other dinner speeches were given.  A guest artist appearance on World Theatre Day expanded our network.  An impromptu workshop with 25 children demanded some skills.   However, by abandoning anything as tangible as a bi-weekly gathering our collective attempts to tweak the strength of our interface lost any sense of grand design.

In response, I sought to long term placed my true work effort into devising a cycle of annual rituals that could gradually expand to feed the citizenry...



(bit from evaluation report - May.  It is flirting hitting all the titles used in the blog pages up to that point) 
It is Written...
As Filosof della Casa, the Davies pen has not been silent.  In a dusty corner of the dusty halls dusty documents have been churned out.  The as yet to be illuminated manuscript for  Il Libro degli Errori is slowly being resurrected from among a soon to be imposing heap of fragments...

Having paraded The Parable of the Rubinetto and carefully unveiled Il non-Credo delle non-Monache notations of our perhaps errant ways have slowly grown less evocative.  The real world collisions of Poverty, Chasity & Silence provoked a lamentable exploration of The Healing Arts and the desire to balance the books prompted an emotional report: The Health of the Idea Fountain.  In plotting a course through the initial phases of Landing, Lurching, Launching, we were forced to closely examine our triumphs.

Some observances of our community as A Social Installation that asserts through example that the masses Occupy Real Work may never come beyond the fragment phase, but in unPacking the un we evoke both The Vow of unSomething and recognise the detail to be gained in practicing the unSlow-Mo.  Examining The Hidden Theatre of the unMonastery may reveal the unMonasterians to be mere Souls in a Scenario; while a renewal of our Psycho-linguistic Strategies is afoot - no doubt culminating in a coherent modular interface. The latest and most promising revelation is the articulation of I Progettini  that can yet prove to be the nuance providing tool with which to appraise our true working surface.

However, Mining the Metaphor of monasticism is not always unPainful; in the harsh world of negotiating the Order of an unOrder it is hard to avoid disorder.   Configured as we are for expression of our uniqueness any Vow of unObedience designed to facilitate movement along The Itchy Road of Self-Sacrifice can easily provoke questions about orthodoxy.  Our research into the Deprivation of the Deprived is unFortunately not conclusive.  And while The Strasbourg Collective Frustration Management Tools clearly captured the prevailing mood of our opening ceremonies, its lessons have yet to be incorporated into our in-house Daily Practice.  Instead we have been left to examine the archeological glass shards of Our Daily unWhoop with perhaps navel-gazing fascination.

It may still not be too late to examine our Filthy Habits, (they can scarcely escape notice.)   At the same time it is written that The Tyranny of Tradition is to be respected :
      “Tradition shall be whittled away, but whittled away at sand corn by sand corn.  Tradition is second            nature, we are neurologically programmed to reach for the flowered scarf as the winds shift to the East.”
Predicated upon a well documented monastic search for perpetual ecstasy, the written record concludes that so far we must still be said to be waiting upon An unMiracle or even, as a last straw - a Prosaic Miracle?


=== Language is Metaphor ===

Language does not more than reflect reality.  A small percentage may be rooted in concrete relationships, but it is by nature subjective.  Someone is doing the talking; using general indications of private association glued together by convention.  The attending imprecision is vast, but it is held together by a deep human need to comprehend.  We project our understanding because we are dependent upon it.  What you says goes.

The Admonition of the Opening Circle : To speak and to listen are higher human functions.   They are not the same as to say and hear.  If the core project of the unMonastery is to find and maintain any balance as the foundation for a functional hub of community service, short cuts in the listening and speaking process are perilous.

The residents of any projected unMoanstery are odd people with an inevitable gene-pool of quirky behaviour.  By nature we are alarmed, concerned and conscious that we bear the brunt of the modern experiment.  No matter how much we fancy ourselves as a vary human default setting for the over-educated hordes for Unemployed Youth of the Earth, the unMo is a fall-back retreat position.  Long may it keep up its good work.




A key personal introductory paragraph of some 6-7 sentences that placed each of us foreigners in a similar plight was proposed at the end of week two.  That the collective interest was not available to allocate time to such a vital tool may have been due to a slip of the pin:  on our board of initiatives - Stimulating Linguistic Diversity was skewered to our ‘in-house’ projects.  As such treated as as personal development.  This was deeply erroneous; learning an accessible amount of key phrases should have been elevated to a central strategic component in our ‘interface’ design.

 The unDo
It is an elemental truth in community service that to do anything at all is to risk censure.  Everything one launches promotes a reaction; filling empty space implies that the space shouldn’t have been empty in the first place.  To do is a critique of passivity.  In the face of the valid lessons in surrender, apathy and fatalism that have inevitably adhered to a society, unilaterally breaking the negotiated stalemate between hope and possibilities is often read as an insult to someone somewhere.

The unMonastery functions as an injection of enthusiasm.   We may or may not be naive, but we routinely assume a classic naive posture: we are here to give.  If we are alert, we may recognise that we have little we can effectively give.  The classic progression as formed by René Dumal states “Recognising we have little we desire to give of ourselves, in desiring to give of ourselves we may realise that we are nothing.  Finding that we are nothing we desire to become, in desiring to become, we begin to live.”  But the modern doer is not trained to begin at the beginnning.  Postulating that we should ideally arrive empty handed may amount to yet another insult.  It is not wonder that humility is an illusive virtue.

The solution to this conundrum is to avoid first generation doing; ones presence is best applied as a response to the established...

An articulated dent... The mountain is massive, our efforts would always remain puny.  Persistence, endurance, applied tunnel vision are often considered vital virtues should we ‘accomplish’ anything at all.  However it is legitimate to question the very concept of accomplishment.  To leave clear directions for the pursuit of as yet unaccomplished accomplishments is often a much better strategy.  Efforts that are anchored locally are worth more than anything that can be applied by the nomadic unMonasterians.  No matter how visionary our initiatives - it is through the resonance and reverberation in our collaborators that we can measure our impact.  Stepping aside at the right moment can be more valuable than stubbornly insisting upon shaping a grand finale

Backlash of middle class imperialism, presumption of our infinite value with such an entire foreign concept of Mapping the Commons  that it defied translation.  it was only withthe name change that clarified the essence of our visit.  Strangers would spend a day in a marginalised corner of the city to share and absorb.  Our ‘day’ could be either a surprise or utterly normal.  Fortunately the PR bit lagged behind, we could promise the moon.  Extracted the keys for one weeks work took two weeks work.

Forcing a satisfactory conclusion seldom gives a satisfactory conclusion.  it would require considerable grace.


=== The Patience of Jove   ===

Finally someone said it: during the planning meeting for week 13 of 17 the strategy that I humbly expressed prior to my decent finally resurfaced.  It surprised even me.

The unMon has a potential function that goes beyond supporting individual project makers during their progressive forays into a hopefully more hospitable foreign clime.  Outreach takes years.  More to the point is that while an unMonastery can quickly become an asylum that absorbs elements of the host society into our ‘free space’.  We are refuge from the known, an enhanced home for liberating activities where we ‘the imports‘ offer a framework and a scattering of skills before stepping aside.

As such we are stronger if we don’t merely seek to attract lone wolves or black sheep, but rather groups from pre-existing organisations that can tweak their activities by applying some unMonastic strategies and techniques.  We at our best can operate as facilitators with a library of health bringing approaches at our fingertips.
 The unMon would then function as a co-operative project workshop - an open workspace sharing participatory practice interface in an open meeting series where all ‘residents’ are expected to contribute.


===     Culture First; then What? ===

(add Vinay in response to Michael Bauwen here)

The ‘Culture of the Enterprise’ is the how we do what we do.  It may not be more than good or bad manners; however we ignore it at our peril. 

The pure// What// of what self-styled social engineers do, is most often a minuscule step in the direction of statistically insurmountable problems.  It is vitally important in its detail, but in all earnestness it is by nature a drop in some glorious bucket.  Unsurprisingly, it is therefore subject to all possible frustrations.    One recurring cause of these frustrations is the //How// things are done.  We may or may not be surrounded by idiocy; it may seem that valuable time may be lost by addressing the //How// as a prerequisite for initiating a viable //What//.  **However, if we ignore the quality of our human interactions it can quickly become difficult to maintain momentum.**

  At the Edgeryder LOTE#3 session on Tools for the unMonastery facilitated by Victor Vorski, we broke off into several small groups.  As is often the case the composition of the groups led them in different directions.   The militant geek group reported first with their list of essential items with which to build a viable community; their key tools were a series of software applications with intriguing names such as //Milkmaid// and //Catch that Tiger//.  The list of the next group reflected other concerns; the one key item was //human warmth//.

It is written in the chronicles of the unMonastery that we live less by rule than by esthetics.  That we   embrace a creed of share and share alike as developed in our circular family culture of evolving virtues.  Faced with a contrary culture of irreverence, it seems a contrary culture of irreverent contrariness.  Adjectives could fly for less.  

The cultural conflict that has so etched the shape of the growth of unMonastery Prototipo Matera should have been caught earlier.  From one point of view the diagnosis seems clear:  the descent of uncouth North European hyper-rational technocrat louts was always an invitation to disaster. Without learning to weave the web of appropriate phrases of diplomatic polite conversation that oil the caring, generous community in which we suddenly found ourselves emerged, those trained to gracelessly hammer home their considered point of view in debating societies and chat forums could do a lot of bruising.  That the straight from the liver style of some of the unMoaners has recently managed to repel four of five of our native Italian participants is sad proof of this tendency.  Some people may have gone anyway, but this triage is on top of alienating our primary local sponsor and primary collaborative partner.  When one favorite restaurant no longer welcomes unMonasterians with the same glee, are we perhaps doing something wrong?


**human connectivity**
The unMo expertise and skill set should be strong enough to form circles of inclusion.  We require techniques to ease people past their personal resistance to identifying as part of a collective process.  This is infinitely more complex when joining a collective experiment; it involves sharing.


**The Edge we Ryde **
This is even more of a challenge because in the recruitment base of say Edgeryders, we are generally dealing with mature individuals who are thankfully beyond the subject to indoctrination age of impressional youth.  We come with our own journeys.  We are also among the fortunate few who have the surplus of attention to examine our own fear.  Each of us has drawn the conclusion that naivety and amnesia is not best policy.  Whipped by what ever version of an apocalyptic vision we subscribe to, the angst we carry gives us different levels of urgency and  


When some ER adopt a rhetoric of issuing directives as if ER operates a head office, then some basics in managing field personnel might be useful.  Rule number one is back your people in the field:  they are up to their necks in local conditions, and have been swallowing more than their fair share of compromises.  They are exercising their best judgement.  If you doubt this best judgement - listen to what is being said.










 
====“Resuscitating the Obvious” ====


  I got re-tweeted - it helps.  The phrase in question was merciless.  It spoke of the one unMo wall that we were least prepared to listen to: our own resistance. 

  Human beings seek the normal: our parasympathetic nervous systems are rigged to de-fuse stress.  Building an organ that calms the being seems a natural collective endeavor.  We all readily read into the word ‘unMonastery’ a world of ordered human interaction; the imagery spoke of  a virtuous life of rigour, obedience, self-sacrifice and service.  However, to tread such virtues down over the heads of one another would be impolite and unDemocratic.  We know better.  The psychic pull towards granting individual leeway negated the very promise of the unMo imagery.  Instead of solemn vows of subjugation to a collective order we became understanding, generous and unFortunately self-indulgent.  We were squatting a monastery, we hadn’t build it from the ground up.

**  An Order of Anarchists**
We do manage the basics: even though glorious cuisine has not always been the stuff of monasticism, at least 50% of mealtimes still emerge as labours of love; (well wrought combinations of the luscious local produce that coated in the olive oil cannot easily go wrong.) 

 Not so very far away up the Apennine Peninsula lie other orders.  Oddly, they seem to be paying more attention to us than we to them.  Inquiries reach us that reveal that amid the network of residual monasteries with a 1200 year old unbroken history are some looking towards our motley crowd of upstarts for inspiration.   The haunting implication that amongst a community of nuns that spend 60% of their waking hours chanting there lurks pockets of self-doubt.  I thought that this was our department...  


**Fallacy of the Post  **
Received at 15:11 came a message that wasn’t read until long after the fact:  “Hi all! We scheduled a meeting at 4PM today. @X is it confirmed?”




  Adherent Prototype Traditions of the unMo
======================

2 february: On our first day of gathering we introduced the morning check-in circle and an evening check-out closing circle.  To regulate 'Possession of the Word' we used an available pomegranate as a 'talking piece'.  Later we switched our piece of ripe fruit to an elegantly rounded, prized stone from possible volcanic sources. (Within days we became addicted to this tool; once when we fell into a spontaneous round table discussion, an impressive big green pepper was grabbed as a stand-in.)  Perceptible shades of content classification have gradually evolved to accompany this ritual. 

4 february: Our prototype collective meeting/eating table was assembled from six pallets in our only warm room. As a tradition we now always start everything as a prototype.

5 february: A rigorous daily 'Liturgy'* was sketched and quickly adopted on our organic prototype basis.  It plotted conventional clock demarcations to provide slots for meals, meetings and work sessions.  We eagerly could assign ourselves tasks and locate one another in our concerns. *available as a 

6 february:  As the need for decisions descended upon us, we performed a dissection of the decision process itself.  During the day, proposals for collective agreement arrive on their own field on our process board wall to face that evening's 'consensus circle' decision making apparatus (usually at least one proposal exposed to the consensus circle make us laugh a lot).  Items can languish in the 'not yet discussed' field before being promoted to agreed actionables. 

6 february: Proposals that don't necessitate a decision became labelled as invitations.  The unadage that we 'Trust the Process' provoked many a nod of agreement.

6 february: The morning planning session that organically emerged from the previous morning circles becomes our ipso facto modus operandi. The desire to get 'to work' provides a disciplinary pressure to keep this gathering streamlined and effective.

7 february: Initiation of the resounding Morning Bell at 0700 hours and collective lingo-physical training occurs in unseasonal sunshiny day.

7 february: First dumpster diving yielded its small treasures: three marginal oranges, genuine cardboard for our endless need to make notices, small crates that shall become kitchen.


===== The unMo Strategies =====

My work scripting the Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions (aka Mistakes) is predominately fiction, in real life we may scarcely know what we are doing.  Golden, promising threads have been painfully dug forth, and then haphazardly dropped at the outer reaches of memory.  Sometimes the life-sustaining idea fountain nozzle doesn’t reach far enough.

A key failure of the unMo was to drop the cohesive circle process in a loud crack.  Impatience and incomprehension lead us to abandon carefully constructed constructs.  The unHoly mantra of //“We are a Prototype”// allowed for impulsively scrapping viable pathways in favour of unProven better ideas.  In the face of legitimate external requirements, we streamlined our daily rituals and contemplative practices.  //“The Process”// was by definition a flexible container; everything was therefore equally valid...  Sacrificing a labourious process to the desire for deliverables may have freed some time but at the cost of considerable precision.  Had we collectively accepted the proffered discipline, we could have approached a desired level of articulation of our work strategies.  It has been almost rudely suggested that our ‘projects’ are merely an excuse for our presence.  That their function is to attract similarly minded people in the local community who may have use for our skills.   Beyond adjusting our nozzle to form a veritable fountain of ideas
 
**Slow-Mo**
Salverio liked the imagery of ‘my hose speech’, it was a fitting metaphor.  Beyond adjusting our nozzle to form a veritable fountain of ideas, it spoke of wisdom.  Community cannot grow a presto.  Roots resist transplantation; no matter how impressive the PR department exhorting the glories of the rubinetto, a trickle is but a trickle. 

The originally floated unMo working model of one year preparing the ground, one year cultivating collaborations, one year handing over the tools - can perhaps be compressed with  appreciable benefit, but it is unlikely that top down exhortations to speed up has suddenly become a viable strategy for community development.  Even with water, earth, seeds and generous fertiliser all in place, we cannot speed up the seasons.  The cycles of landing and launching, labouring and perhaps loving all take their time.  The unMo idea still requires an organic pace.  Forcing it provokes false steps.
The previous generation of lightbulbs worked through resistance: the greater the resistance, the greater the heat and light generated.  Actors are similar, the slower it takes for information to work its way into the consciousness, the deeper it sits.  Quick fixes and decisions fly by or bounce off.  Dwelling upon, wrestling with and periods of contemplation provide another kind of truth.
In the quick fix modus, the unMo took a promising, flashy initiative...  we sought to define ourselves.


===== Totems for Meetings and Movements  =====

converting inevitable energy traps into visionary balance

My work as the Society for the Promotion of Human Rites embraces conscious use of the tools of theatre and elements of ritual -- hopefully beyond the sanctified field of art.  Strategically applied, moderately heightened rituals can inform the content and highlight the significance of our gatherings. 

The closer one navigates to our deepest dystopian fears, the more one collides with people´s acute discomfort.  This can be psychically costly.  Aware of this cost, it is wise to design our gatherings and workplaces to channel the inevitable frustrations of practice and communication shortcomings, into valuable awareness.  Our recognition of our vulnerability becomes a major strength.   At the recent Living on the Edge gathering of social activists in Strasbourg, one discussion circled around this need to defuse potential negative energy before it could capsize our efforts.  The next day, a group of us convened a topic group to design a tool to do just this.  Someone had called this a totem pole the day before, we gladly adopted this concept...



The LOTE topic group went to work establishing two polarities of constructive and destructive forces that haunt all people´s movements. I´m away from my notes, but the idea that evolved was to literally and ritually construct twin pillars at opposite sides of a working space.  One pole was conceived of as a protective ´lightening rod´ -- it´s chore to ground all negative energy and render it harmless.  Around this pole we imagined: ceremonies to process moments of conflict

At the other end of the garden or workspace, we would erect a corresponding positive pole Here we would align our mission, renew the noblest of goals, and celebrate palpable triumphs. 
The quality of the dancing around each pole would differ significantly. 

The desirable aspect of the concrete physical totem, steadfast in its place, is that when needed, it forces the assembled to examine any conflict not just as the issues themselves, but as a mechanisms of life. We are not only examining today’s problem, but everything that has occurred since last we gathered in this position. Equipped with this perspective, one can then return to the issues at hand with renewed awareness.

In my performative tradition the mask is sacred.  When carved in a tree, the tree is to remain living after the mask is separated. I suggest that the creation of totem poles should be similarly ceremonial.  The greater the time and significance put into their erection, the more richly they speak to us.  Local artists could be engaged, not necessarily to create an object of beauty, but rather to include core stakeholders in the build.

Our proposal is that the idea of polar totems can be made adaptable to various kinds social change endeavor:  from the internal group weekend workshop, to  the ‘occupation’of a public square.  Edgeryder members are currently exploring the establishment of Edgeryder Stations: nomadic residencies that can house hubs of our member´s activities while promoting cross-fertilisation with local community activists.  Each of these stations should include twin totem poles to define, and refine, our awareness.
