====== Recruitment & Initiation - Bringing people on. ======

^ Recruitment Design Patterns                               ^^
^ Problem             ^ Implementation       ^
| There's no fair and open process for bringing in new unMonasterians      | Individuals can be recruited on a case by case basis but it's important you have a clear and concise top level process that everyone agrees to prior to having to deal with it. Upon arrival design a step by step process together - that contains expectations, requirements and your offer to anyone wanting to join your unMonastery  |
| Not knowing who is and isn't an unMonasterian      | True unMonasterians follow [['The Protocol']].  |
| Someone doesn't live in the building but wants to be a core part of the team | It's important to create tiers and roles for varying levels of engagement in the project, the Benedictines had the Oblate, the unMonastery has it's own Oblate  |
| The recruitment process keeps leading to the same sorts of people joining the project and is damaging diversity |  It's important to stage conscious of the privilege and diversity of your brotherhood at each round of recruitment, ensure you reach past your usual networks when recruiting and balance appropriately. The unMonastery relies on effective collective intelligence to get things done, a lack of diversity decreases the quality of your collective intelligence |

===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

Within the unMonastery the kitchen functions as the heart of the operation, everything you do will be determined by the way in which you run your kitchen. You must serve the kitchen in the same way as it serves you - acknowledge that it is your core communication infrastructure, both for internal organisation and as a tool for inviting people from outside. As such you should take care to pick an appropriately sized room in your building, ensure there is space for a large dining table, that can host up to 10-20 individuals. 

Always keep it clean, be militant in your approach and ensure your daily routine is able to support the cleanliness of the space. 

>>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.

Above and beyond cleanlinesses part of running a successful kitchen is ensuring everyone is fed and dietary needs are catered for well. In order to do this efficiently in Matera we went through a series of steps in the first month to ensure we would be well provided for going forward, this work was established by Cristiano as is as follows: 
  - Visit all local suppliers within the town or city you are based, note down all prices and quality of food ([[https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yQVNkknCkB_62xC3WWHAn7AWj_wUwaDKXWF3QBRu71k/edit#heading=h.xcctwvhfx0jd|Matera example]]), your bias should be ethical over financial, evaluate the price and distance for Local, Organic and possible alternatives. 
  - Since you're going to be buying in large quantities try and establish deals with store owners, or consider trading skills for food. 
  - Once you've identified the appropriate suppliers (locally produced, well priced food), establish a rolling weekly schedule for doing the shopping. 
  - When living in a small city or town, it's important to build up personal relationships with the producers and suppliers, so ensure the same person goes to the same stores on a rolling basis. In order to get a good price ensure who ever is collecting initial prices for food stock is of the same nationality as the country you're in. 
  - Use the unMonastery Food Analytics system to maintain an overview and keep track of all finances and data relating to your food consumption.

===== Alternatives / Recommendations =====

== Reference 1 ==

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 

== Reference 2 ==

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
