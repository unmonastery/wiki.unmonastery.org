===Mining the unMonastery Metaphor===
From the moment of the first public voicing of the unWord at the LOTE#1 gathering, exploring the imagery of the unMonastery has been a source of joy and inspiration.  What started as perhaps a rather flimsy premise has been consistently strengthened by the latent power in the history of monastic practice.

At LOTE#2* a sub-group spent three days hacking “The Lore of the unMo”.  (provide link if it exisits) Extracting direction from our collective associative matrix, we shuffled together a collective document that generated much seductive mirth.  Much later, a brief conference call comment from Bembo sent Alberto off on a pivotal exploration into the credo of the Benedictines.  (This should be considered mandatory reading – as it traces the evolution of a decentralised anarchist movement of radical dropouts that has lasted 1200 years.)

To continue this valuable work of metaphor mining at LOTE#3, we chose to step into the future.   In a tactical attempt to lift our visions beyond the next mealtime, we went all historical. Under the banner of something appropriately enigmatic, three groups formed to look back upon the various époques that have so influenced our unMovement the last 200 years…

one group examined the unMo Age of Expansion and the influence of the Matera School with an emphasis upon the first hundred years.
group two examined the Times of the Great Schism and the unMo Wars through the fitful fifty years of unPleasantness.
 a third group sought to pinpoint where and how some 200 years ago the foundation of the unMo idea formed a Watershed moment in the history of interhuman/interspecies cooperation. 
The debate was as usual vigorous; an attempt to replicate its central threads is performed here:
(Books 1 + 2 were inadvertently destroyed during recent renovations, an attempt to reconstruct them from the oral tradition awaits an opportunity.)

Group 3 —    watershed = key breakthrough 
decisive moments that enabled the unMo
to so negotiate successfully:

//Although a minority of historians claim to have unearthed evidence among archaic web logs that reveal that the legendary early delegates, to say, the Matera Meeting of 2013, were an unPrecedented bunch of tossers, the accepted wisdom is to praise them for their foresight.

Key choices to avoid the divisive extremes of visionary projection, and to hold developments to the current realities generated a robust, flexible practice.  The early unMo communities became expert at the culture of change and in harnessing the collective wisdoms of groups with an uncanny capacity absorb positive organic small scale inventions that recycled much energy into their community service.

Their work was clearly  value based – not solely determined by the tasks at hand, but through an articulate shared vision that remained flexible and syncronised even when working in a decentralised, work distributed pattern.  

So skilled at transforming conflict to creative friction did we become that major organisations such as the International Union of Black Sheep and the Disgruntled Young Peoples’ Alliance ( formerly unEmployed Youth of the Earth) quickly found their way to the unMo.  The total package lifestyle solution that supplied a meaningful life of dedicated service and camaraderie, rapidly became so essential to many people’s existence that the unMo practice became the cultural norm.  
Once the movement reached this critical mass, it exhibited such acute flexibility as to virtually unUnmonasterise itself, providing a wide dispersement of wisdom without any signs of confining ideological dogma.

Perhaps the key development upon which the movements survival was predicated was the broad endorsement of invisible structures.  So culturally implicit in their collective decision making process did this become, that the unRule became dictated by the daily tasks and seasonal rhythms rather than any planning organ.  This new freedom quickly permeated the unMo vision of service saving considerable regulation and meeting time.

For example, since they did not seek to replicate the apartheid of the sexes, the early unMos required creative solutions to mitigate what appeared an impasse.  While the less unPalatable term of the unMonasterian still circles in the literature, (Presumably so us to not to frighten the uninitiated), the choice to adopt the universal gender of the ‘unNun’ was never unWrong.  As a demarcation of a deeper commitment to tweak historic connotations, it freed us of an insidious rhetorical constraint.  Despite initial confusion, it soon became clear that, independent of individual hormonal configurations, we could all stand proudly forth and declare that:  “We are unNuns.”

This ritual act of surrendering your gender was of course bad anthropology, most of us still identify deeply with our chromosomes.  Fraught with danger, this bold symbolic step towards redressing the wounds of the past, required  several years of contention before we acquired sufficient dis-entrenchment tools and the community was prepared to sample the wisdom in this idea.  When none of us are nuns; we can all take an equidistant step away from the subservient role historically thrust upon them.  If, during periods in our process, the work requires moving towards the traditional realm of the nun, those of both hormonal lineage could take these steps with respect.  Through the years other non-skill oriented general titles were employed.  These denoted seniority or perceptible personal engagement, and often reflected local social alliances.

The Art of the Party
The bi-weekly cycle of Open Parties fired the daily life of the unMos.  The 26 annual markings of the meeting places between what at the start must have appeared a minor, incoherent sect, quickly grew to become a vital interface with the host community.  Designing ritual celebrating for each Season, for the Elements, for traditional local and global traditions, and including children and families these most human of gatherings both enhanced and informed the strategies of community take-over and the de-unMonastration process.

==The Book of Greater and Lesser Failures.==
A key tool in the spread of the unMo idea was a capacity to admit our fears and vulnerabilities.  Not all unMo work progressed smoothly.  More than anything else the erection of ‘Strasbourg Totems’ as a central ritual element of evaluation provided the unMonasterians with a tactile manner to recycle their inevitable frustrations.  Meeting regularly round the magnetic negative Pole to balance their aims and strategies and process any unPleasantness.  That they would then quickly re-form around the triumphant positive pole to dance their simple truths of humanness, allowed them to keep.

UnunMo
At some point ER and unMo vanished as a distinguishable organ, dropping its identity as people became absorbed by a deeper unity of purpose.  Years of interdependence while constantly promoting fresh ideas and renewal, lead to the  dissolution of formal structures at organic points.   And while the functions of a collective work station for itinerant freelancers certainly became the norm and unMo-like houses still littered the countryside, so much a part of the fabric of life had they become that other alliances defined the networks.//
