===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

 It is important to identify what are the elements that connect people, as everyone comes to the unMonastery for different reasons. Personal expectations need to be articulated from time to time, as they evolve during each unMonasterian's stay. However, the unMonastery works primarily as a "we".


>>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since ((the 1500s)), when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised ((in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum)) passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
