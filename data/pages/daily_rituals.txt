===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

The original schedule: wake up at 7am for the sound of the bell. Morning practice, breakfast, morning circle, start workday. Lunch at 2. Work afterwards. Dinner at 8, rest, closing circle, bedtime. It turned out that this structure fluctuates significantly depending on the specific group of people in the house, on current events, on the season. It proved best to allow changes to occur and backtrack if things got out of hand. Rest was particularly difficult to ensure when there were great differences between life rhythms of occupiers.

===== Alternatives / Recommendations =====
---------

== Reference 1 ==

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 

== Reference 2 ==

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
