====== Challenges	-	Site specific Issues ======

^ Design Patterns ^           ^         ^
| [[stakeholders|Stakeholders]]  | The challenges represent the stakes why local resources are invested in supporting an unMonastery, and never should be taken flippantly.       ||
| [[projects|Projects]]   | Ideally, personal and group projects of the unMonastery overlap with the challenges given. ||
| [[language_barriers|Language Barriers]]   | It is necessary to learn the language if solving the challenge(s) require communication with the community. It is also desirable to learn the language as discovering challenges is a healthier way to contribute. Given challenges inevitably represent the interests and problems of the people who give them to you.|

===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

'Challenges' are tasks or problems, the basis for the unMonastery's work as a contribution to the host community. Challenges come from two sources: they are given by the local community as a list of problems it hopes the unMonasterians will help solving; and they are discovered by time, as the relationship between the town and the unMonastery develop.  

>>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.

On March 23, 2013 there was a public town meeting held at the Mediateca in Matera, where citizens gave their input about the problems they see with the town. Nearly a year later, the unMonastery arrived with 11 unMonasterians signed on to solve these “challenges”. The original list contained 46 items. Later this was reduced to 12.
