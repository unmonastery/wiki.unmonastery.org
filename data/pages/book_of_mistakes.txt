====== The Book of Mistakes / Il Libro degli Errori  =====

It is written somewhere that history may inform our current endeavors.  History has indeed dictated that the lessons of //The unMonastery// be collected in a singular fashion.  Although earliest known sources have the title as **//The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions//** this is not the language of the street. The more punchy title //**Il Libro degli Errori**// stuck. 

We are thus doomed to be judgmental upon our every action.  It is a curse as much as a blessing.  Of course this too may prove an //unMistakable mistake//.   That several other wisdoms with less catchy titles are also interwoven into this visionary text is the cost of having a more passionate than precise PR department... 

==== The archives were full of wisdom. ====
In the virtual cellars of the unMonasterians lie scattered commentary.  Largely written in the age of the send button, it is more the raw material of boundless wishes than the winnowed kernels of genuine sustenance.  Gathered together in retrospect, this combined selection from diverse documents reflect the gatherers as much as the writers.  At the same time the unMonastery penchant to drop its threads into a vast web of interlocking public space permits seemingly unEmbroidered voices to pop up at any juncture. 

The historian’s cleft between oral and written sources has widened by the void of the unopened e-mail.  In a landscape where near and far sit perched at their several scriptoriums for more hours a day than is healthy, there is no reassurance that that which has been posted has ever been taken to heart.  Where once there was the singular //Word// : to be illuminated, studied, and ceremoniously regurgitated in song, we are now surrounded by hyper-text. Despite the distracting background noise //Il Libro degli Errori// is an attempt to bridge the chasm between expressed intention and the illusive record of that which has actually been heard. 

**Il Libro degli Errori** is undertaken as a meditation on our mistakes: not to apportion blame or to chastise co-workers or ourselves, but as a message to the future.  Some of our initial fumbles, classical conundrums, persistent attacks of stubbornness may escape our notice.  Along the way it seems equally relevant to catalog our triumphs, where we failed to fall into potential traps.  Early on, the very first unMonasterians created a spontaneous infirmary to offset a compromise on the health of a member caused by the extreme damp conditions in the unheated dormitory, a night at our favorite B&B was commandeered.  As Rita Orlando put it in today’s morning circle: //It may become a huge Book of Mistakes, but hopefully not a Book of Huge Mistakes.//

We need to isolate where we are perhaps over-reliant on our flexibility and goodwill…


===== A Tour Guide =====
The Book of Mistakes reveals its message on several levels.  It can be read from beginning to end, although it clearly was not written in this direction.  

**The Chapter Titles** are with one exception, imports.  They were devised as key elements with which to prepare oneself should a group of people contemplate initiating their own unMonastery or unMonastery-like conditions.  They therefore function more as a demanding stretch than a comforting framework.

Written in red (or in boxes on the wiki) is a narrative text that strives to orient the reader as to the issues illuminated in each chapter.  It often takes **the voice of rationality**.  Those who feel bound to understand may be able to merely lift their understandings directly from here.  

Splattered more boldly throughout the text are an assortment of numbered operating **‘principles’**.  These are often to be found embedded in more of their context somewhere else.  These have been elevated by popular demand - Should anyone wish to commit anything to memory, or create a run of up-market tea bags, they would be a good place to begin.  The numbering system is vestigial, after Wittgenstein.   

The rest of the text is considered to be **‘evidence’**.  These are lifted from various sources and juxtaposed beneath the banners of the chapter titles and the principles.  These have been compiled to illustrate the quality of argument as the language of our ‘prototype’ has been hammered out along the way.  They also may give more insight into the daily life of the unMonastery as residents and their primary stakeholders tended to litter various media with a vast array of what was known as Documentation.

Still other aspects of the text are incidental artifacts, imprints of the tools left around by its primary builders; from time to time Katalin Hausel and the Designated Philosopher exchange encouragement or impatience as they spiral towards a deep fondness for their construction. 

**The Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions** is not finished.  Before the house packed up for an unDisclosed period, it was proposed that our written legacy acquire the form of an annotated scholarly work.  unMonasterians near and far expressed the desire to leave their trace upon the collective record.  In the current design their observations and additions should enrich the textual turf at every turn.  In practice this has not been forthcoming; an embarrassing large percentage of the material seems to stem from a single voice - the house scribe who was tasked with keeping a running commentary on an invisible weblog.  It is likely that many of his words of wisdom remain to this day hidden away out of the sight lines of his fellow unMonasticians.  In the current edition an attrition factor stopped us from providing every last footnote to the scribe’s ramblings.  Should the reader wish to directly experience his legendary long-windedness this can be easily arranged.  

History has not always been written by the battle-worn.  The effort to clean up in one’s own cellar has been uniquely rewarding.  The contradictions between theory and practice, between musings and matter are mercilessly naked.
