======  Culture First; then What? ======


(Ben: ? The young Vinay in response to Michael Bauwen here ?)

The //‘Culture of the Enterprise’// is the //how// we do //what// we do.  It may not be more than good or bad manners; however we ignore it at our peril.
 
The pure //What// of what self-styled social engineers do is most often a minuscule step in the direction of statistically insurmountable problems.  It is vitally important in its detail, but in all earnestness it is by nature a drop in some glorious bucket.  Unsurprisingly, it is therefore subject to all possible frustrations.
   
 One recurring cause of these frustrations is the //How// things are done.  We may or may not be surrounded by idiocy; it may seem that valuable time may be lost by addressing the //How// as a prerequisite for initiating a viable //What//.  However, if we ignore the quality of our human interactions it can quickly become difficult to maintain momentum.  

At the Edgeryder LOTE#3 session on **Tools for the unMonastery** facilitated by Victor Vorski, we broke off into several small groups.  As is often the case, the composition of the groups led them in different directions.   The militant geek group reported first with their list of essential items with which to build a viable community; their key tools were a series of software applications with intriguing names such as //Milkmaid// and //Catch that Tiger//.  The list of the next group reflected other concerns; the one key item was //**human warmth**//.

It is written in the chronicles of the unMonastery that we live less by rule than by esthetics.  That we   embrace a creed of share and share alike as developed in our circular family culture of evolving virtues.  Faced with a contrary culture of irreverence, it seems a contrary culture of irreverent contrariness.  unAppreciative adjectives could fly for less.  

The cultural conflict that has so etched the shape of the growth of unMonastery Prototipo Matera should have been caught earlier.  From one point of view the diagnosis seems clear:  //the descent of uncouth North European hyper-rational technocrat louts was always an invitation to disaster//. Without learning to weave the web of appropriate phrases of diplomatic polite conversation that oil the caring, generous community in which we suddenly found ourselves immersed, those trained to gracelessly hammer home their considered point of view in debating societies and chat forums could do a lot of bruising.  


**Human Connectivity**
That the straight from the liver style of some of the unMoaners that may have managed to repel four of five of our native Italian participants is sad proof of this tendency.  Some people may have gone anyway, but this triage is on top of alienating our primary local sponsor and primary collaborative partner.  When one favorite restaurant no longer welcomes unMonasterians with the same glee, are we perhaps doing something wrong?

The unMo expertise and skill set should be strong enough to form circles of inclusion.  We require techniques to ease people past their personal resistance to identifying as part of a collective process.  This is infinitely more complex when joining a collective experiment involves sharing bedrooms, digestive disorders and bad jokes.


**The Edge we Ryde **
This challenge may be augmented because with the recruitment base of say Edgeryders, the unMonastery is generally dealing with mature individuals who are thankfully beyond being subject to indoctrination age of impressional youth.  We come with our own journeys.  We are also among the fortunate few who have the surplus of attention to examine our own fear.  Each of us has drawn the conclusion that naivety and amnesia is not best policy.  Whipped by what ever version of an apocalyptic vision we subscribe to, the angst we carry gives us different levels of urgency.  Flexibility may be subject to supply and demand.
