something from Alberto, I think edited by me

**
 What we are doing - details?**
The unMonastery draws inspiration from 6th century’s monastic life to encourage radical forms of collaboration and innovation: a sort of lay, off-grid mendicant order striving for a society that can better withstand present and future systemic crises. Behind this project lurk the rise of hacker culture amid the deepening structural crisis of Europe. These two trends leave more and more young, educated, connected and generous young people who aspire to hacking a deep societal fix, at a healthy arms-length from both the public and private sectors. Not buying into the “gonna change the world” Silicon Valley rhetoric; innovation, for them, means not inventing marketable gadgets, but tackling the fundamental problems of establishing a fair social deal, retaining individual freedom, crafting an environmentally sustainable society.
(intro ER here)

Their walks of life seem unsettling, even dangerous to most of us: they are no strangers to nomadic lifestyles, squatting, cryptocurrencies, hardware hacking. They are technologically savvy, idealistic and almost always poor. The unMonastery offers them a deal similar of that of the monasteries of old: lodging, board and time to think and realize their ideas, relatively free from the need to make money.

Much like the early monasteries, the unMonastery does not seek economic sustainability through business planning: rather, it tries to be as self-sufficient as possible (for example through urban farming practices) and to embed itself in a local community with which to trade in kind rather than in money. This move allows unMonasterians to sidestep the unemployment problem completely: a happy, meaningful life is about making something that others will find useful, rather than one in which someone buys your time against money. At the same time, it encourages unMonasteries not to depend too much on the money economy – which is a good thing, since you cannot trust it to stay up in a systemic crisis.

**What we've found? Any success so far?** (112 words)
A first breakthrough was simply finding each other. A year ago 27-year old Londoner Ben Vickers connected with an Europe-wide online community called Edgeryders, and through it to kindred spirits in Sweden, Italy, Norway, France and elsewhere. This created a first core of founding unMonasterians that could develop the project. The second breakthrough happened when Edgeryders developed a partnership with the Italian city of Matera, that agreed to host an unMonastery prototype as part of its own future building strategy. Matera added to the mix a very interesting unused building  and, even more importantly, an interface to a local community that wants to evolve and has some meaty problems to deal with.

**Based on the above, what advice would we give to councils?** (126 words)
There is much talk about smart cities, but many local communities are left on the sidelines if they cannot pay for expensive (usually proprietary) technologies. The unMonastery provides an alternative path: put the smarts in people rather than in artifacts, and use networks of individuals (mediated locally by the physical unMonastery building, and globally by the unMonastic “order”) to store and grow such knowledge. Imagine having a place where you can ask for help in developing social innovation initiatives in your local communities. It would help young people by providing them with opportunities for creative engagement in their communities, particularly in areas of deprivation. Also, it would enable local people to use their understanding of their communities to improve both their own skills and their place.

time frame  --  In the conceptual stages, it is not always strategic to accept compromises before one is forced to do so.  Keep the dreams big enough to do some real work.  My experience is that one year can be a frustrating short period of time:  we'd get there, sweep out the bureaucratic encumbrances, solve the logistics of food and water, meet some fascinating people, launch a few roughly sketched ideas, and start to pack.  

In the art of community development, one is advised to proceed gingerly.  To assure that the mission's work corresponds with genuine/perceived needs - one establishes ones existence through ones own projects, and then waits(patiently) for the community to figure out how they can use you.  After that the true collaboration / cross fertilisation can occur.  In the end, one can retreat almost unnoticed as the local population now runs a viable concern.  I'd suggest that a three year time frame would more easily house these three stages. Also it may (or may not) be easier to generate local enthusiasm for something that is going to be active for a while...?

That said short visits can work, I have witnessed a very effective skills transfusion program in the Balkans where a team of facilitators working out of Wien descended upon a town with a circus tent over twelve containers that in addition to providing self-sufficiency in cooking and housing -- opened to become recording studios, printing shops etc where they offered various courses.  They did some very good work in only six weeks, though by their third year on the road they had halved the number of towns per year, and doubled their stay to 3 months.  Their most concrete contribution was to leave behind a functioning local radio station at each community.

Monasteries have a longer tradition than is immediately comfortable.  Historically they honour the outcast.  It times of need they represent a treasure of knowledge and continuity.  They exert strict discipline upon their contributors.  Inside their walls visitors may renew their most valuable connections with humanity.

To host an ER UnMonastery may be dangerous.  We will offer refuge to your questioning youth; we will seek to model a mode of life that demands more of our inner selves than the modern civilization outside our walls...

Cheek is good: and you do it so well...

As usual I wrote too much to simply push the reply button.  I put it here and trust that it doesn't get lost.  if there is a favorable spot so that all our replies all appear beside one and other; can someone either let me know and/or insert this appropriately.

Response to Ilaria 14.03.2013

Dear Carlo Magni :    It is very good to have a name to talk with.  Just talking about dreams without a real person there, is nowhere near as satisfactory...   The same is true for the project as a whole; all my experience tells me that the ideas and the fantasy are just to get you to the starting place; once you actually begin, you have to return to zero and build upon reality.

Is it therefore possible that I don't answer your questions at all ?  - a naughty boy boycotting the exchange out of fear of building an intellectual construct that at best can only be a shadow of reality. 

Instead, I offer the following statement of belief:  this project smells as if it has all the correct ingredients ready to be put into place.  A space for a sustained human meeting, basic needs met or meetable, a community of people who expect that they will find good work and inspiration in each others company.  Solving all of the practical questions before hand, is not desirable; it is through this solving in cooperation that the unique character of the unMonastery will develop... 
 
But, that said, here we go at the Here we go:
 
//
In what way Matera's characteristics meet the objectives of the unMonastery?  //

--- the ground feeling behind the unMon idea is that the Edgeryder group has potentially more to do with each other outside of meeting halls, and closer to real life.  Anchoring this real life in a real community is utterly logical.  One of our main desires is to be adept at adapting to diverse host communities;  the selection of Matera has seemed an organic process --  as we are developing our prototype, it will prove a worthy dialog partner no matter what Matera's strengths or weaknesses may be ---  a imperfect community that welcomes us and is eager to see us succeed.
 
//
What are the needs that have been foreseen for the city of Matera by the unMonastery team?//

We talk about several issues: internally we have to create a viable living rhythm that enables us to research the unMo life form, we can then to turn out to absorb the qualities of potential interaction with the community at large.  We know that some of the outcomes of our stay should be tangible and lasting: before having started it is not only difficult to say what these may be; it may also be dangerous.  To say that we wish to give, before finding out who we are, and therefore what we have to give -- is not the best personnel management style.  Each unMon will have its own core group, and then incorporate a stream of visiting contributors  -- each of these shall be encouraged to listen to the greater community in their own way.
//
 
What should the people of Matera expect from the project and in what way can they be part of it?//
In my opinion, we have been thinking a bit narrowly about the project -- ideally I reason we should be there for three years:  year one - we map out the territory, and invent our magnificent ancient traditions; year two - serious work builds towards some impressive creations; year three - the jobs of the unMonks and unNuns get taken over by resident Materani.  Are the Materani expecting miracles, do they have a history of being disappointed by Northerners, might they wish to join in the work?  The specifics lie in the specific projects.
 //
What do the unMonasterians expect from the city of Matera and its inhabitants?//

We sincerely hope that you will be yourselves:  good, caring hosts.  You are also encouraged to be typical human beings: and give us your impatience, minor bureaucratic tendencies, forgetfulness and other aspects of human imperfection; it is only by you being a busy, multifaceted urban environment that we will have to learn how unMonasteries develop our characteristic strategies for survival in the face of such reality.
 
//There is an ongoing discussion in Matera regarding the possibility of becoming a place that fosters "creativity tourism": the donation of ideas and visions coming from changemakers that come to the city and are hosted with the aim of starting and developing projects in the city of Matera.  Do you think that Matera can be such a place?//

Please, we have to be there first.  If Matera does indeed have a unique set of resources for building a visionary community, we can be a good indicator as to this being possible.
 
 
//What are the next steps for the launch of the unMonastery? When will we start seeing unMonasterians walking around the city?//

The launch will provide a dash of concrete stimulus to a few of us --- We have yet to formally recognise the desirability of having a distinguishing unMon clothing style that would indeed enable you to spot us immediately.  I am thinking long kilts, at least for the men.
