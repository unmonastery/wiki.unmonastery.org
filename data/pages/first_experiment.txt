====== The WORK ======


1.2
To //do// is a critique of passivity. ((At a key juncture the early unMonasterians wrestled with community resistance. The lessons of community development needed reiteration.  Strategic considerations  came up with came up with this justification for what would become one of their major success points: //**Una Giornata a Piccianello**//:


==== The unDo ====

It is an elemental truth in community service that to do anything at all is to risk censure. Everything one launches promotes a reaction; filling empty space implies that the space shouldn’t have been empty in the first place. //To do is a critique of passivity.// To unilaterally break the negotiated stalemate between hope and possibility in the face of the valid lessons of surrender, apathy, fatalism and stagnation that so easily adhere to a society, is often read as an insult to someone somewhere.

The unMonastery functions as an injection of enthusiasm. We may or may not be naive, but we routinely assume a classic naive posture: //we are here to give//. If we are alert, we may recognise that we have little we can effectively give. The classic progression as formulated by René Dumal states //“Recognising we have little we desire to give of ourselves, in desiring to give of ourselves we may realise that we are nothing. Finding that we are nothing we desire to become, in desiring to become, we begin to live.”// But the modern doer is not trained to begin at the beginning. Postulating that we arrive empty handed may amount to yet another insult. **It is no wonder that humility is an illusive virtue.**

The solution to this conundrum is to avoid first generation doing; ones presence is best applied as a response to the established…

(note to co-editor: this might be enough to illustrate the point; the link then reveals a more extensive sources.  This has a bit to say about how the book appears.  Online this could work, in book form it is not very useful.  Nevertheless, I obviously now remove some of the footnotes that just repeat text without offering additional anecdote. The second part of this 'article' could possibly be attached somewhere else.)

**An articulated dent… **
The mountain is massive, our efforts would always remain puny. Persistence, endurance, applied tunnel vision are often considered vital virtues should we ‘accomplish’ anything at all. However it is legitimate to question the very concept of accomplishment. To leave clear directions for the pursuit of as yet unaccomplished accomplishments is often a much better strategy. Efforts that are anchored locally are worth more than anything that can be applied by the nomadic unMonasterians. No matter how visionary our initiatives – it is through the resonance and reverberation in our collaborators that we can measure our impact. Stepping aside at the right moment can be more valuable than stubbornly insisting upon shaping a grand finale.

Backlash of middle class imperialism, presumption of our infinite value with such an entire foreign concept of Mapping the Commons that it defied translation. It was only with the name change that clarified the essence of our visit. Strangers would spend a day in a marginalised corner of the city to share and absorb. Our ‘day’ could be either a surprise or utterly normal. Fortunately the PR bit lagged behind, we could promise the moon. To extract the keys for one weeks work, took two weeks work.

Forcing a satisfactory conclusion seldom gives a satisfactory conclusion. It would require considerable grace.http:[[//bembodavies.com/2014/07/12/the-undo/]]))  ((A sample reaction to one project by unMonasterians: "//Unfortunately I have neither the time or the will to be polite, so let me be rude and say that I'm asking you to stop your creative performances. it is not because I don't appreciate creativity and jokes. What I really DON'T appreciate is that this is happening under the unMonastery umbrella: there are people who have been working hard (and they have committed their lives) for the success of the project that also means  to tell to citizens that we're not a bunch of squatters and to demonstrate that THEIR money (your money comes from citizens duties, did you know?) have been used for something meaningful.//" KH)) ((The general principle here is that by acting as unMonasterians must within the host community, their very existence casts a negative shadow on permanent residents, as their actions throw the others' inactivity into sharp contrast. The mistake runs in two directions: frantic  production of un-thought-through results may be truly destructive; and righteous zeal can lead to hostile reception. KH))

1.4
The unMonastery functions as an injection of enthusiasm. 

1.5
Persistence, endurance, applied tunnel vision are often considered vital virtues should we ‘accomplish’ anything at all. ((It says what it says, but it is //unBelievably// bad theatre.)) However it is legitimate to question the very concept of accomplishment.((
Living in a labyrinth, it is tempting to set up camp in the relative comfort of a familiar cul-de-sac.  The way forward invites even more heart-wrenchingly false steps; inertia is safety.)) ((This point belongs in the Clients' Book of Mistakes. KH)) ((We may or may not be naive, but we routinely assume a classic naive posture: we are here to give. If we are alert, we may recognise that we have little we can effectively give. ))



==== CHALLENGES ====

1.0
The modern doer is not trained to begin at the beginning.((At this point it is important to note that the //what// of the question of doing was not clearly defined from the beginning, therefore it is impossible to judge whether the //how// was misconceived or not. It may have been the case that the things started were simply not the same as the things that got carried on. KH)) ((Efforts that are anchored locally are worth more than anything that can be applied by the nomadic unMonasterians.))



==== PROJECTS ====

1.0 
Our projects shall and must dissolve to redefine their arc.

==== I PROGETTINI ====

1.0
Progettini are our conscious positive steps in close-up.  They are the openings opened, our daily desirables.

2.0
Identifying the refined facets of our living interface helps us evolve our true projects; we can begin to interact with reality.

==== INTERFACE ====

1.0
The cultural conflict that has so etched the shape of the growth of unMonastery Prototipo Matera should have been caught earlier. From one point of view the diagnosis seems clear: the descent of uncouth North European hyper-rational technocrat louts was always an invitation to disaster.
 

====== The WE ======


1.0
The one mandatory qualification for a life as unMonk/ unNun is that we are humans.  Humans forget; denial is our speciality.  One task of the unMonastery is to become a library of experience: to remind one another.  Removed from the coddling of modern convenience, we shall live a life that confronts our civilizedness.  It is our capacity to surmount this confrontation that is the true fruit of our labours.

2.5 When one doesn’t understand oneself, it is easy to feel misunderstood.((Without any of our endless rounds of indecisive discussion, something had happened; we were to be immutably corporate-branded out of the blue. Without asking, someone somewhere had made the bold assumption that: we were who we said we were where we said we were. Our magnificent palace of a house was to be boldly labelled “unMonastery” with the leaf-green logo that we had happily been using for the last 11 months. Semi-understandably, we the unGrateful, were having none of it…))((Behaving like naughty children, we became treated as naughty children. In a fit of adolescent hubris we declared independence, and psychically moved beyond the range of parental influence at first opportunity.))


1.0 
No Complaining Policy.((The recollection is faulty. Having gone to the extreme of invoking a No Complaining Policy, it seems logical that even in those most playful early days the unMonasterians deemed it …necessary.))

2.9
The corollary of no complaining is no blaming. ((In our hyper-humility we recognise that our fellow humans are human. They will take action, they will refrain from taking action. The forces are many and largely invisible. The joy of feeding the collective effort can mysteriously evaporate from time to time.))

==== SOCIAL HYGIENE ====

1.0
Feelings of sacredness are not immediately contagious; they require active transference. ((The one mandatory qualification for a life as unMonk/ unNun is that we are humans.  Humans forget; denial is our speciality.  One task of the unMonastery is to become a library of experience: to remind one another.  Removed from the coddling of modern convenience, we shall live a life that confronts our civilizedness.  It is our capacity to surmount this confrontation that is the true fruit of our labours.))

2.0
Rituals to ease the transition from the evil habits of a civilian were meant to be [the Scribe's] territory; in practice a fear of appearing a cult has left us frighteningly normal.

3.0
The psychic pull towards granting individual leeway negated the very promise of the unMo imagery. Instead of solemn vows of subjugation to a collective order we became understanding, generous and unFortunately self-indulgent. We were squatting a monastery, we hadn’t build it from the ground up.


==== HERESY ====


1.0 
Uniformity is neither possible nor desirable. Differing personalities enrich a community. However manifesting an agency of social cohesion requires concerted effort. We pull together.

2.0
Contrary to popular myth, the unMonastery does not operate by way of rules.

3.0
What was once a miracle, can easily be taken for granted.

==== THE CIRCLES ====

1.0
To speak and to listen are higher human functions. They are not the same as to say and hear. If the core project of the unMonastery is to find and maintain any balance as the foundation for a functional hub of community service, short cuts in the listening and speaking process are perilous. ((2 february: On our first day of gathering we introduced the morning check-in circle and an evening check-out closing circle. To regulate 'Possession of the Word' we used an available pomegranate as a 'talking piece'. Later we switched our piece of ripe fruit to an elegantly rounded, prized stone from possible volcanic sources. (Within days we became addicted to this tool; once when we fell into a spontaneous round table discussion, an impressive big green pepper was grabbed as a stand-in.) Perceptible shades of content classification have gradually evolved to accompany this ritual.))

==== INVENTING TRADITIONS ====


Missing main on prototyping. ((4 february: Our prototype collective meeting/eating table was assembled from six pallets in our only warm room. As a tradition we now always start everything as a prototype.))
