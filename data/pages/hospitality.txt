===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

Inviting people over for coffee or meals, instead of meeting them outside of the building, allows for respecting frugality and near-moneyless existence by individual unMonasterians. It also reinforces the perception of "We" by our friends. Inviting people to stay at the unMonastery and share their ideas and skills is greatly beneficial to the community and can be a source of re-energising. All staying guests need to be informed of house habits, so that hospitality can be balanced with rest and work of each resident.

>>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since ((the 1500s)), when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised ((in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum)) passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
