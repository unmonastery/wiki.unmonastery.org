7.2 (i Progettini II)

Community development projects cannot thrive in a sterile environment.  They have to be sown, to germinate and to take root before they can grow.  The juried project proposal system that sifts the pure genius from the less pure genius does just that; the proposed projects are descriptions of the applicant’s imagination.  Suddenly surrounded by reality, that same imagination should be encouraged to evolve something radically different.

7.21
It is written somewhere in the unMo literature that projects are to be shattered upon arrival.  It is written somewhere in the literature that itinerant unMonasterians are to create their existence human contact by human contact. Parachuting in with our pre-formed beliefs leaves us with a mentality of adjusting the terrain to fit the map.

7.22
Healthier for all concerned is to perform an illuminating arrival ceremony of burning one's preconceptions and application text.  If, at some point in the future, the charred remnants may be dredged forth from one’s memory, they are thereby all the more valuable.  However, it is equally legitimate to build a completely other project.  -- It is carved somewhere on the unMo walls that we should //“Listen always to what is emerging”//. 

7.3
Massive projects can get heavy.  Delivering deliverables can evoke tunnel vision.  The stubborn spectre of perfectionism can rear its head; projects artificially supported by conceptual scaffolding can get all bad mannered and unruly in the face of reality. 

7.31
To counteract this the preferred project management device is the articulation of sub-objectives with which to illuminate the day to day occurrences which nourish the project environment.   In the unMo, part of this articulation is instinctive; however our grand mission can get easily obscured by pressing immediate concerns. So while the way of the world encourages independence, performance and cleverness, we unMonasterians risk a quick extinction unless we employ human skills that foster camaraderie, generosity, and deep inter-reliance.  

7.32
Taking the time to articulate the need to cultivate these inner workings that support all our efforts is a vital step.  Our greater PROJECTS are to be constructed of //progettini//.

7.4
//I Progettini// are the connective tissue of life in the project world: they are the conscious choices that align our availability and project our willingness to listen.


===== i Progettini =====

The grandiose project //Mission Statement// is meant to be an unObtainable wish – a navigational star placed so conveniently far from reality – that no matter how convincingly we have bashed our heads against the wall, it remains there shining in the heavens as soon as we regain consciousness.  If we prove off course, we can swiftly spot our orientation and adjust our direction.

When the guide post for a major project exists at such a distance as to defy nuanced perspective, we must often turn to our practical daily interactions in order to at all measure any forward motion.  However, if we can then adjust the terms of our examination with even minor degrees of magnification, progress becomes quickly breathtaking.

To facilitate our daily, more prosaic growth it is desirable to deconstruct The Upper Case PROJECT into component ‘//progettini//’.   Progettini are our conscious positive steps in close-up.  They are the openings opened, our daily desirables.  Focussing upon these natural by-products of a project description can inform us when we are really doing what we intend to be doing.  Identifying the refined facets of our living interface helps us evolve our true projects; we can begin to interact with reality.


Listing the **component virtues** of our projects may seem distasteful.  Our //‘virtuosity’// is meant to be discretely ingrained within all our worldly activities, to articulate the desire for such attributes comes dangerously close to brashly claiming their presence.  Even if projects aren’t meant to be humble, we their perpetrators must be.

Our elegant solution this is to withdraw into our group circles, to distill our desirables via a collective process that masks our personal ambition and elevates the inherent vision to a function of the 'We'.  If an individual were to humbly suggest tentative project virtues that might help us //unMonasterians// align our day to day work, a brief list might look like this:


  * participatory — leave behind the experience of doing the work


  * visceral — incorporate the joy of physical effort at that core of the exchange


  * inhabit a linguistically level (or lower) playing field  


  * elegant — in accomplishment and idea 


  * demonstrative of the creation of surplus value


This short list of //i virtù di progettini// of can readily be extended through the actor’s homework tool of articulating one’s //subtext//.  What is it we do when we are doing our real work?  Or as Brother Siri once put it to the group: //What are the experiences of WOW that made you feel that this was what being an unMonasterian was all about?//  If our daily objectives remain expressed in too unspecific a language as, say,  //“I will do some good”//, we remain general and toothless.  By breaking down our objectives into component parts, we gain useful precision…



==== The Subtext of Good Works ====
 

* **Form Friendships**  This is the easy one.  Every society has its social fault lines, the schism between those who routinely embody subconscious values, and those that actively set the same values in question.  Along this division lie human cells of curiosity that readily open for connections with our available friendship receptors.  People seek people.  People seek like minds.  Hampered by linguistic unProficiency (even as some of us daubed in Duolingo), the cultivating of human warmth becomes the currency of our exchange, fumbling forwards with grace and humility.
 
 * **Forming friendships** remain our first five objectives.  Variations on the theme may provide us subtle re-writes such as: **Expand your network**, or **Gather concerned citizens, Unearth strategic allies, Build emotional support among like minds**.  The true basis action of all of the above //progettini objectives// is feeding potential friendships. Then we can continue with our other strategies...

* **Stimulate Cohesion / Cultivate the We**  – The inner workings of the enterprise needs must be solid.  To give each other enough space for all personal foibles is not necessarily best policy.  //The Art of Self-Sacrifice// may be a finicky creature to introduce and then tame, but without it we merely replicate the environments that have driven us to this impasse of supplicating ourselves to the unMonastery process in the first place.  Working together helps.

* **Promote Co-consciousness** – Above and beyond documentation our work needs definition.  Coincidently, creating the one can beget the other; however, the flaws of both pen on parchment and obscure blog comment is that the best lain words of many can be consigned to a ridiculously short shelf-life beneath an enormous mountain of virtual dust.  -  It is proposed that all documentation be hatched in pairs. Such texts in equal parts impeded and enriched by each other have an added value of tweaking convergent vision.

* **Value Emotional Growth** -  This goes without saying that by investing of our humanity we seek to stimulate the occupation of new territory among ourselves and our collaborators.

* **Spawn Fresh Initiatives**  – As project managers everywhere will happily testify, the sign of a good project is when it takes over its own steering.  It is in the nature of projects that they beget projects.  One can debate the absolute wisdom, but at certain stages of project life: the more the merrier.(It has been noted that everyone who walks through the unMo doors seems to engage us in at least two additional pursuable projects… )  However, while drowning in brilliant ideas is a familiar symptom of even a healthy enterprise, not all shall find fertile soil, and an effective short, quick filter system for registering, recycling, shelving, allotting and decapitating schemes and dreams in favour of a clear tactical progression of actionables is a vital tool to possess.
