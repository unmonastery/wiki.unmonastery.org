**the Kitchen should be nurtured like a Queen**, I say! and given importance as a space of meeting and promoting the creation of relations and consequently possible good ideas! I believe there is be the possibility to have a big table for meals... and that is really good, I think. http://edgeryders.eu/comment/5834#comment-5834

the unMo kitchen must be the Goddess of our Existence.  Around this primal field of interaction, we shall channel our mutual nourishment and develop our culture.  While it is not necessary that all supplicants to the unMonastery document their qualification as a gourmet chef; it shall be a shame if they are not so when/if they choose to leaveâ€¦

(Sharpening the Edge)
The one mandatory qualification for a life as unMonk/ unNun is that we are humans.  Humans forget; denial is our speciality.  One task of the unMonastery is to become a library of experience: to remind one another.  Removed from the coddling of modern convenience, we shall live a life that confronts our civilizedness.  It is our capacity to surmount this confrontation that is the true fruit of our labours.
