===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

It is important to take a wide view on this - not only picking your best friend who you worked with a million times, but acknowledge skills you don't have and share your project with people with really different skill set than yours. It is hard to overcome preconceived ideas about what counts as "work" - group reflection may be necessary. Remote working and in-house collaboration both require leadership, which may not come easy to the person whose project needs them. Generally communicating what you are working on allows people to step in at points you may not even realise as important (for example, realising that others have been working on similar projects, or with overview of political climate).

>>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since ((the 1500s)), when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised ((in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum)) passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
