====== Manual For Stakeholders ======


==Introduction==


  - THE IDEA 

We accept that at this point in history retreat is as legitimate as growth; that models of collective effort reflected in collective life indicate a path of optimal low-consumption human deployment; that a synthesis of urban and regional survival strategies might provide a platform for future life; that 'frugal abundance' can be an attractive strategic goal that provides significant emotional satisfaction.
The unMonastery proposal is to amplify this emotional satisfaction through evolving cultural forms that promote valuable social spin-off and interspecies solidarity.  The key is hard work.
     
        
The unMonastery is an [[http://extrastatecraft.net/About|infrastructure space]] (... infrastructure generates emergent new constellations of national, international, intergovernmental and transnational administration and generates undeclared forms of polity faster than any even quasi-official forms of governance can legislate it.) which allows people and groups on the fringes of society, who normally have no common interface (citizens of small towns on periphery of Europe; nomadic hackers), to interact and work together to solve problems both on local and global scale. Combining existing resources ([[http://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/feb/23/europe-11m-empty-properties-enough-house-homeless-continent-twice|unused buildings]]; idealistic, highly educated, skilled people refusing or unable to join the job market; hacker culture; design patterns for sustainable living) unMonastery addresses diverse contemporary issues like [[http://uk.businessinsider.com/europes-youth-unemployment-at-233-2014-9?r=US|youth unemployment]], depletion of skilled workforce in remote areas, [[https://www.iisd.org/sd/|sustainable development]] and [[http://www.wikiprogress.org/index.php/Social_cohesion|social cohesion]]. 

   
      

  
  - THE PLACE 

The unMonastery is not a building nor its inhabitants.  The unMonastery is the role it acquires in collaboration with its hosting community. It is based upon a contract offering unused resources (a building) in exchange for a residency of the best people we can recruit who are willing to adopt a lifestyle of service. It is based upon an act of faith: that the inherent wisdom of the model will inspire good works.  The Art of unMonasticism is to render our work clear, relevant and in tune with local aspirations.  It is essential that these aspirations accurately reflect realistic expectations.
   

   

The unMonastery is a building -  usually a temporary location for a group of unMonasterians. It consists of living quarters: shared bedrooms, bathrooms, a library; and community spaces: a kitchen, areas for working and gathering. The community spaces are open to anyone while the building is open (usually 10am to 11pm Tuesday through Sunday). There is a daily cooking schedule, two people preparing meals for everyone. Cleaning is done together, shopping, garbage and other chores are distributed. The unMonastery is modestly but functionally furnished with furniture and objects, preferably reused, or made of recycled materials. Energy and water consumption and waste production are monitored and published monthly. The unMonastery is a [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safe-space|safe-space]] for everyone.  
    
  - THE PEOPLE 

Along the chain of action points from the initial invitation and the vetting of the suitability of a future location to the first opening of the doors any number of concerned citizens may attach themselves to greater and lesser degrees. -- All of these can be considered stakeholders; some, however, will insist on joining us in getting their hands dirty.  How can you help?  What are the requirements for hosting or joining an unMonastery?  How is this a key investment in improving our survival potential?  

This Handbook is designed to be able to indicate what we consider the most reasonable answers to these and other questions.

  

 The unMonastery is the people. A highly diverse network of social innovators, hackers, software engineers and artists, writers, designers and architects, gamers and activists working together with their local equivalent to develop practical, tangible projects supporting both their local and global communities. 

  - THE CULTURE

The unMonastery is technologically savvy community based on certain aspects of medieval monasticism. Excluding religion, hierarchy and gender separation, unMonasterians aim to combine commitment to working on both local and global (or universal) issues; live a more rounded and healthier life than the urban existence they leave behind; respect each other, the place, the people, cultural and personal difference; share their skills and learn new ones. 



  - THE ORGANISATION

unMonastery is a horizontally structured organisation based on self-initiative and inclusion. 


  - THE EQUIPMENT   


The word “equipe” comes from French, meaning team. The unMonastery equipment consists of its people: those physically present in the building, their global network and the local community.

Explanation on Culture of Work and Process / Expectation Management Primer 
Individual Stakeholders 











=== 1.0 Stakeholders are the ones whose fingers get smashed when the full force of the sledge hammer doesn't quite hit the stake they are gamely holding in place. ===
 

Stakeholder Handbook: The unMonastery is no clandestine operation, it aspires to involve as many interests and approaches into the process as is organisationally possible, as a result of this aspiration the at times intricate negotiation between individuals and groups can be experienced as a minefield - the Stakeholder Handbook is designed to help orientate and coach future Stakeholders and unMonasterians in maintaining these relationships.

*inspired by A6 , as tight and schematic as one can get.  simple paragraphs with titles and GLO links*
    
THE IDEA - can this be done without writing an ethics code?

The unMonastery: a space which allows people to work/play and cooperate who normally have no common interface (citizens of small town on periphery; nomadic hackers). How to frame the goal, the underlying purpose, the rules and parts of the unMonastery so that it serves everyone. How to weave concrete actions so they implicitly lead to systemic change by an evolving mutual comprehension of shared stakes.
   
It is necessary to keep a perspective: preparing for WW3 may not justify the financing of an unMonastery in a small town with no resources. Does not mean to bury all ambitious, global, visionary goals, - it just means to always design and communicate progiettini and projects with both local and global outcome in sight. 

==== A Library of Experience ====
For the first 20 years each unMonastery must be considered a bold experiment.  Only with time can we become an established, traditional life form.  This manual and its expanded version the Book of Greater and Lesser Omissions is a tool to help evolve successful and healthy roots.


- "stake" is one of the key questions of unMonastery: the existence of an unMonastery in a community means that they share the stake in the success of the social innovation project(s) they are working on together. That unMonasterians can just leave and never look back causes a huge lack of faith in their proceedings, and this needs to be addressed. While at this moment it is not possible to expect people to give up everything before they join unMonastery, certain attitudes can be developed. The so called super-hero expectations are not viable, for either side, as it is impossible to deliver deep solutions quickly and single-handedly. However, waiting until the host community asks the unMonastery to help is also not viable - in fact it is just an extension of the super-hero attitude ("you cannot do it without us"). unMonasteries need to embrace the idea of service, to generously offer ideas and plans, without expecting an immediate response. unMonasterians need to prove that they are committed and earn the trust of the community by demonstrating that what is at stake is also theirs.
(This is GLO stuff, no? -- it is very touchy to step into the neutral voice of opinion.)
   
   
THE PLACE - political climate
   
Using the unMonastery Roadmap board and the MethodKit card set, it is important to create a map of local actors, expectations and relationships in order to understand where unMonastery is located in the political scene. It is naive and useless to pretend to be above or beyond politics. 



  
THE PEOPLE - expectations
   
THE CULTURE - human warmth, communication patterns, talking piece -- bridges between urbanites/vestigial peasantry, re-booting democracy




THE ORGANISATION - protocol : do-ocracy vs strategic participatory practice

ER's do-ocracy ethos is not possible to implement, as is. Doing things to enable other people to get involved, instead of doing things to get the project done, is far more effective and desirable.  
       
THE EQUIPMENT - technology and human contact (rituals)
    
Play.
      
What makes people work together is a common enemy. This cannot be anything that is part of local culture, even if in fact that is the most obvious obstacle to get things going. Locating a small common enemy is much easier if kept at progiettini level. Small doable effective projects that allow locals and unMonasterians work together on solving a specific problem. 
   
THE WORK - in-house/ interface/ outreach

Preliminary: understand as much as possible. This is first step for unMonastery-stakeholder collaboration. Stakeholders and unMonastery needs to define a common goal which cannot be as broad as "social innovation". It has t be specific and achievable, a goal that unMonasterians can deliver and stakeholder can stand behind if delivered as a tangible result.
   
Recruite unMonasterians with relevant skills, for all 3 aspects of work.
   
Weave the three together and make unMonasterians to understand each other's role. Tech vs culture cooperation
   




   
EVALUATION/ LEGACY - keeping a diary: either by assigning the job of "the scribe" to someone or collective documentation wiki-sprints at the end of each weak. Or both.

"//Stakeholders - it is more about our reluctant and slow recognition that we need to pay attention to MT2019 and their needs. I remember that in early February, I tried to understand the immediate goals, and found that "we" (a movement lead by elf and strongly supported by Ben - and you) did not care a bit about the "challenges" - the projects and MT2019's motivation to fund the project. I felt confused, not having had a lot of experience with ER hackathon style dream-projects without any connection to reality. [In art you always have to deliver. The opening date is not moveable, the problems are a source of creative invention, and there is no such thing as *complaining*. It does not even need to be lawed out, there is no point, the gallery will not change its inner workings for a single show, materials will not be cheaper, the funding will not get bigger, and it is only your career that gets harmed if you don't deliver.] So. Stakeholders is about reality. Money, the bid. Stakeholders can also be about Edgeryders. In fact it would be a great thing to think about, whether ER as a community enjoying immaterial endless freedom to TALK can ever be a stakeholder? Talking is not a stake. ER the company is a real stakeholder, and was forced to back down a few times//."((KH letter to BD, September 2014)) 

====== Project information ======

====== Artistic quality ======

=== 3.0 The unMonastery has never been a popular hit — for that it is too conceptually unDefined. It is ‘something doing something’; its fruits won’t mature until after its doors are closed. ((http://bembodavies.com/2014/08/25/creative-deconstruction/)) === 

      

The unMonastery prototype launched early 2014 in the City of Matera, working with the city and local community it became a flagship project for the city’s bid for European Capital of Culture. Working with the city’sadministration, unMonastery played a pivotal role in shaping, developing and delivering the core values of the bid. In September Matera was declared winner of European Capital of Culture - praised for it’s prioritisation of the 

arts, the unique ability to galvanise citizen participation, it’s leadership in opensource technologies and an “open to all” agenda. The judging panel declared “Matera as a starting point for a grassroots movement for renewal in Europe.” 

In the last year unMonastery has received praise from a wide range of journalists, influential public figures and policy makers. Bruce Sterling in a recent video described our work as that of the “avant garde of Europe”. Michel Bauwen (Head of P2P Foundation) cited unMonastery in his open letter to Pope Francis as a project that seeks to “revitalize our world”, and the RSA asked whether 2014 may be the year of the unMonastery. 

The unMonastery has had 50+ press articles published including; Huffington Post, Wired, The Nation, The Guardian and Vanity Fair. In addition unMonastery was invited to present at over 30 events: Future Everything (Manchester), Miami Design Basel (Basel), Transmediale (Berlin), Unlocking the Potential of the Social Economy for EU Growth (Rome), Royal Geographical Society Annual Conference (London), Improving Reality (Brighton).

====== What is your proposed artistic activity, and what do you want to achieve by doing it? ======

The unMonastery Bios is an opensource toolkit for starting new unMonasteries and evaluating individual projects within unMonastery - the toolkit will be available as a free download and print on demand product. Designed on the principle that all knowledge generated should remain open to all, easily accessible and applicable to other organisations’ efforts and initiatives. The toolkit will encompass the entire knowledgebase generated from the prototype and ongoing development. The toolkit is composed of 6 core elements, outlined in depth in the attached document. 

Supporting the online launch we’re working with organisations to host public events and workshops to boost release of the toolkit. Including Near Now (Nottingham), HowToWorkTogether (London), Transmediale (Berlin), Islington Mill (Manchester), EdgeRyders and Matera2019. ACE funding will be used to cover costs related to producing the toolkit and costs related to hosting public events and workshops. 

*For Context: EdgeRyders is the community the unMonastery emerged from; composed of a pan-European network of artists, policy makers and hackers working with organisations such as the UN, Rockefeller and UNESCO to design citizen led participatory processes. 

Inline with long term objectives of unMonastery; our primary goal is development of a rigorous and pragmatic toolkit, capable of supporting replication throughout Europe. Our secondary goal is to ensure wide-scale distribution specifically in the UK, for our learnings about new networked organisational forms through workshops and events. 

Additional goals include; Increased UK participation in unMonastery’s development; New partnerships for creating UK based unMonasteries; Reinforce bridges built between diverse disciplines.

====== Why is this activity important for your artistic development? ======

The unMonastery Bios comes at a critical moment in our development, as we enter negotiations with organisations in the UK, Italy and Germany to establish upto 6 unMonasteries. This creates three very clear needs for unMonastery, 1) Development of a toolkit with clear documentation and concise instructions, 2) Capacity, through recruitment of new participants and partners, 3) Clear communication and wide dissemination of the projects value. 

The unMonastery Bios launch series will be the first round of public events to formalize and share the activities of unMonastery with a UK and international audience, representing two years of intense development. Through extended public discussions, the launch series will serve as a pivotal time to regather the collective of artists and hackers involved. Ensuring support for the dispersion of the ideas and the unMonastery model itself in key locations, actively connecting institutional spaces and larger audiences with emergent interdisciplinary practices. 

It’s important to note - unMonastery is vital not just to our own artistic development but to the very scope and potential for cultural spaces to continue to exist in Europe; with accelerated collapse and retreat of The State, compacted by the failure of the free market to offer viable alternatives - we urgently need new bottom up approaches and solutions to issues such as rising rents, studio provision and limited opportunities for career development within existing economy. unMonastery is a model necessitated by and designed to face these critically important questions, so we can move forward together into an uncertain future.
