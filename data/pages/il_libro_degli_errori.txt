1.1 (**the unDo**)
To unilaterally break the negotiated stalemate between hope and possibility in the face of the valid lessons of surrender, apathy, fatalism and stagnation that so easily adhere to a society, is often read as an insult to someone somewhere.((A sample reaction to one project by unMonasterians: "//Unfortunately I have neither the time or the will to be polite, so let me be rude and say that I'm asking you to stop your creative performances. it is not because I don't appreciate creativity and jokes. What I really DON'T appreciate is that this is happening under the unMonastery umbrella: there are people who have been working hard (and they have committed their lives) for the success of the project that also means  to tell to citizens that we're not a bunch of squatters and to demonstrate that THEIR money (your money comes from citizens duties, did you know?) have been used for something meaningful.//" KH))

1.2
To //do// is a critique of passivity.((The general principle here is that by acting as unMonasterians must within the host community, their very existence casts a negative shadow on permanent residents, as their actions throw the others' inactivity into sharp contrast. The mistake runs in two directions: frantic  production of un-thought-through results may be truly destructive; and righteous zeal can lead to hostile reception. KH))

1.3
We may or may not be naive, but we routinely assume a classic naive posture: we are here to give.((The reluctance of Materani to believe the authenticity of even the //intention//, undoubtedly further removed the probability of proving ourselves at least harmless. KH))

1.4
The modern doer is not trained to begin at the beginning.((At this point it is important to note that the //what// of the question of doing was not clearly defined from the beginning, therefore it is impossible to judge whether the //how// was misconceived or not. It may have been the case that the things started were simply not the same as the things that got carried on. KH))

1.5
Persistence, endurance, applied tunnel vision are often considered vital virtues should we ‘accomplish’ anything at all. However it is legitimate to question the very concept of accomplishment.

1.6
Efforts that are anchored locally are worth more than anything that can be applied by the nomadic unMonasterians.

2.1.0
Living in a labyrinth, it is tempting to set up camp in the relative comfort of a familiar cul-de-sac.  The way forward invites even more heart-wrenchingly false steps; inertia is safety. ((This point belongs in the Clients' Book of Mistakes. KH))

2.1 **(no Complaining Policy)**
The recollection is faulty.  Having gone to the extreme of invoking a //No Complaining Policy//, it seems logical that even in those most playful early days the unMonasterians deemed it ...necessary.


2.2
In the face of unilateral paternalism, we temper tantrumed. 
 

2.3
Behaving like naughty children, we became treated as naughty children.   In a fit of adolescent hubris we declared independence, and psychically moved beyond the range of parental influence at first opportunity. 

2.4
A case may be made that some of us perhaps exhibited an unVersion of attention deficit disorder...((Matters were complex to begin with. The need at the very beginning of the pilot in Matera to sketch a wall-size illustration of the network of stakeholders and intellectual contributors to the project before it even hit the ground should have been a warning sign of confusion and conflicting interpretation of goals and interests to come. KH))

2.5
When one doesn’t understand oneself, it is easy to feel misunderstood. 

2.6
Without any of our endless rounds of indecisive discussion, something had happened; we were to be immutably corporate-branded out of the blue.  Without asking, someone somewhere had made the bold assumption that: //we were who we said we were where we said we were//.  Our magnificent palace of a house was to be boldly labelled //“unMonastery”// with the leaf-green logo that we had happily been using for the last 11 months.   Semi-understandably, we the unGrateful, were having none of it...

2.7
Of course we weren't a vague generic product of the //unMonastery Industry//; we were our own blossoming creature of great beauty. 

2.8
Our intentions were crystal clear - at least to us: while the 'unMonastery' of our parental lineage remained an utopian ideal, we wrestled with a firmer reality.  We were the genuine article; in our heart of hearts we had indeed progressed a step further along our pathway, we were the unMonastery Prototipo Matera. 

2.9  
**The corollary of no complaining is no blaming**.  In our hyper-humility we recognise that our fellow humans are human.  They will take action, they will refrain from taking action.  The forces are many and largely invisible.  The joy of feeding the collective effort can mysteriously evaporate from time to time. 


3.0 **In Quest of Marginality**
unMonasterians are by nature oppositional.  One doesn’t become a social activist by going mainstream.  Without taking grasp on this essential dynamic we floundered wildly.  While it was strategically necessary to define, refine and reinforce the project’s adherence to the margins, we, in a moderate case of culture shock, sought to meet expectations.  This could never fly.

3.1 (unPacking the un)
That we would be ‘a monastery’ without being a ‘monastery’ was immediately compelling; the very words ignited the imagination....  We are in equal parts haunted and liberated by what we aren’t…

3.2
With time there were further conversations.  Words such as unSanctified and unConventional filled the unAtmosphere.  What we meant by all this remained for the future to determine, but a deeper question went unAnswered:  **//If we are not-pious, not-self-sacrificing, non-believers, how can we work very real miracles?//**

3.3
Inevitably we brought difficulties upon ourselves.(([[http://edgeryders.eu/nono-edgeryders-nono-unmonastery-nono-mt2019-sick-and-tired-of|Some of us]] more than others. KH))


**The We / Heresy**
Uniformity is neither possible nor desirable.  Differing personalities enrich a community.  However manifesting an agency of social cohesion requires concerted effort.  We pull together. (("//What I see as one of the key elements of the unMonastery is that it has the ability to create a community out of complete strangers within a very short time period. And in the last 4 months this has been constantly undermined by the different expectations for communication: the where and how of reporting problems,  listing achievements and soliciting solutions. The details here matter, but I will not get into it now. In my recollection, the real crises started when the group as a unit was disrespected.//" Excerpt from [[http://edgeryders.eu/comment/11647#comment-11647|a post]] on the Edgeryders platform. KH))

Individuals whose deeper psychic make-up does not readily allow for a ‘we’ require additional balance.  For various reasons stimulating this balance can become such a drain on the community as to command a disproportionate amount of attention.  At vulnerable, particularly early stages of forging the ensemble, it is often necessary to say "no" //‘earlier than later’// to novices that exhibit chronically disharmonic behavior.  The pedagogic spin-off from taking such a seemingly harsh decision can reward the flock in mysterious ways.

4.1 (Deprivation and the Deprived)
The group of Great Schism never submitted its literature.  They did however send a few representatives to the unMo…

4.2
Arriving at the unMonastery in times of plenty it is perhaps impossible to intuit times of sparsity.  The healthy pantry of March doesn’t reflect the empty cupboards of February.  What was once a miracle, can easily be taken for granted. 

4.3
Contrary to popular myth, the unMonastery does not operate by way of rules.  In our time we have enacted but one rule:  **No Complaining**.  Try as we might everyone has found the capacity to break this rule repeatedly.  At all other conjunctures we have compelling aesthetics: such is the way of the unMonasterian. 

4.4
UnMoaners are inevitably pleasant souls.  Our first resident rebel snuck in unannounced through the back door unJuried by anything than camaraderie.  Knowing he couldn’t abide the disciplines, our first pilgrim from the sub-sect of the schism seemingly set their not-unconscious sights at being a self-declared //‘heretic’// — intent on breaking all available rules.  Problems occurred in that orthodox unMonasteries have no rules.  What we do have is observances and practices: esthetic boundaries that are to be respected even as they be inevitably stretched.   


4.5
Food was a holy sacrament, other people’s sleep was similarly sacrosanct.

4.6
In the early stumbling days of //Mining the Metaphor// the endless questioning of barely established practice was merely unRuly.

4.7
Support the leadership, not by virtue of being leadership but because they are doing their best in a vulnerable position.
