## Trash

In the building *we do sort the garbage*.

### Trash categories
We have several containers corresponding to trash categories. The containers are upstairs (in the middle room) and downstairs (in the kitchen).

* **Organics (downstairs only)**
* **Plastic and aluminium**: only **_clean_** stuff should be put here. It is put together because in Matera it is taken away at the same time.
* **Paper / card**: only **_clean_** stuff should be put here. For example used pizza boxes can't be there because they contain fat.
* **Glass (downstairs only)**: **_wash it_** before putting it here.
* *Unsorted*: should be kept as small as possible.

**Important note**: upstairs use only containers for _plastic_, _paper_ and _unsorted_. All other trash should be put in the container downstairs.

### Taking garbage away
In the Sassi of Matera the garbage is collected door to door. As we are not on a main street we have to put them on the pavement of the street (roughly in front of our main entrance). Of course it should be put in recyclable bags / boxes in a proper way.  
The garbage is collected very early in the morning so it should be taken away the day before, in the evening (after 10 PM).

Here is [[http://www.comune.matera.it/images/VADEMECUM_Raccolta_differenziata.pdf|the guide]] (in Italian) from the commune of Matera.

* **Monday evening** : organics and paper / card
* **Tuesday evening** : unsorted
* **Wednesday evening** : organics and plastic / aluminium
* **Thursday evening** : unsorted
* **Friday evening** : organics and glass
