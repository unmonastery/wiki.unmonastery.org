====== The Quest for Marginality ======
 unMonasterians are by nature oppositional.  One doesn’t become a social activist by going mainstream.  Without a clear grasp on this essential dynamic, we at times floundered wildly.  Instead of understanding that it was necessary to reinforce, refine and define our marginality, we sought to meet external expectations.

While our flag flew high internationally, in the field the unMoansterians got mired down in daily contradictions and seemed at times to provide a target for uncomprehending disdain.  Permission to proceed slowly and carefully was not forthcoming; performing front and centre was an understandable virtuous act, even if it was contrary to our nature.
