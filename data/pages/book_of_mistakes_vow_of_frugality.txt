====== The Vow of Frugality in Abundance ======


Not all unMonasterians were refugees from the precepts of capitalism; habitually some practiced private ownership: my towel, my dirty laundry, my laptop.  Whereas one legendary brother had no physical truck with money, everyone else retained functional pockets and/or even credit cards.  Although there was evidence of //generosity//, those independently wealthy remained so.

We held no ceremonial pooling of resources.  For a while, sweets and prized alcoholic beverages were hoarded by some for a suitable occasion when the cumulative sense of deprivation required a jolt of joy.  An occasion of blatant pilfering brought an end to this practice at a time when the general advance in living standard had caused few of our meals to even resemble being frugal.

The unMonastery didnâ€™t necessarily do //humility// either.  Instead it can be said that we exercised great pride in our individual ability to prepare quantitive mealtime feasts for one another.  Working in teams of two celebrated a great sensual pleasure where creative minds would descend upon our larder of seasonal vegetables; in the glee of innovation many would spare but little thought for the raw material left for the next team who would soon face the exertion of overdoing the previous meal.  No one starved.

Another moment of //nourishing competition// among unMonastarians is in the recruitment of dinner guests.  Crowding our eating benches with people willing to sample our fare was seen as a highly virtuous act.

On the obverse, sinful side of these enactments of culinary pride was an irregular sit-down strike.  From time to time the kitchen forces unilaterally declared a //pizza day//.  These occasioned restaurant visits that could emphasise the inequality of economic resources.  Visitors and those with an external revenue did not feel bound by the same frugality as that which constrained the rank and file unMoaner.  This was seen as a personal matter and the hardship forced upon the others was not always addressed.  Although our local pizzeria was far beyond a local pizzeria; it could not always match the heights of home to which some of us had become accustomed. 



====The Wow of Chastity, Frugality and Obedience====
Hidden behind the potentially highly-marketable slogan of The Wows, the veteran house scribe bemoaned the excesses of the relatively youthful.  Not so very vague proposals collided with the realities of readily implementable adjustments in the unMoaners ingrained habits.  The idealogical stance of the intrenched was: //I am who I am//.  The Vow of Sobriety was not to be taken lightly.  On his way out the door this 'complainte' was left behind in the midden heap of whistful musings...
