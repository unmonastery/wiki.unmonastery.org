====== Communications - How do you engage and publicise? ======

This item is an early attempt to integrate the card format and will likely be scraped. Although several items listed require illumination is hasn't yet found a form and therefore lacks clarity.

the theme seems bigger than publising issues.  


^ Design Patterns      ^   ^
| [[online_presence|Online Presence]]     | (it is not enough, but necessary)   ||
| [[language_barriers|Language Barriers]]   | Speak the language. ||
| [[political_climate|Political Climate]]   | Understand the power structure that surrounds you. Make sure you reach others than your stakeholders. ||
| [[uniform|Uniform]]    | Communicating presence. ||


===== Description (with anecdote) =====
---------

Opening the doors is not enough, making everything available online is not enough, organising workshops and events is not enough. Hardest part is to find out how you will reach the actual target audience. Identify structures of information transfer: in Matera it meant moving from informal communication to formal:

  * Identifying target audience.
  * Speaking with key people, allowing the information to spread though private channels.
  * Setting up a Facebook event page.
  * Send out Newsletters and emails.
  * Get on local TV and in local papers, so people can recognise it as something they heard of and now is familiar (is "real").
  * Posters.



===== >>> QUOTE AND OR ANECDOTE FROM HAPPENINGS.<<< =====


Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since ((the 1500s)), when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised ((in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum)) passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
